He thrives to create design solutions which conceptually and elegantly emphasize the surrounding area, along with the clients’ needs and interests. As an artist, he draws his inspiration from the neighbouring communities and their unique history and characteristics. He also finds inspiration in nature, where everything is at once minimal and deeply practical. Movement and animation are also evoked throughout his body of work, to engage, entice, and encourage public interaction. He hopes to express in form the dynamic balance needed in life, between fun and function, rest and action.  

Over the past few years, Pierre has been involved with many large scale design projects, with clients ranging from the city of Vancouver and the 2010 Olympics and Paralympics, the city of Toronto and Oakville, to the Peace Bridge Authority of Fort Erie, the Walt Disney Corporation, Princeton University, XM radio for Toyota/Lexus Canada, GreyEagle Casino, Toronto’s Royal Canadian Yacht Club, McMaster University, and Concord CityPlace’s ultra-chic, Panorama Lakeshore Condominium Tower.In addition to his design consultancy work, Pierre also has a successful furniture line, Mitosis, which was featured in the Globe and Mail, Toronto Star, and Toronto Life magazine, and has also been recently commissioned to become principal furniture for the lobby and lounge areas for Princeton University’s Julian Street Student Library. 

Pierre’s background in industrial design and biochemistry, coupled with his creativity, methodology and technical computer expertise, give him a unique approach and process to art and design, while keeping in mind the delicate balance needed between materials, environment, fun and functionality.";;;;http://www.pierrepoussin.com

These sculptures are by nature temporal and ephemeral, challenging the traditional and formal qualities of the medium. By incorporating actions into the process, and utilizing photography to capture and convey the experiences, the boundaries between art, daily life, spectator and participant break down.While Wurm considers humour an important tool in his work, there is always an underlying social critique of contemporary culture, particularly in response to the Capitalist influences and resulting societal pressures that the artist sees as contrary to our internal ideals.Erwin Wurm, born in Bruck an der Mur/Styria, Austria, lives and works in Vienna and Limberg, Austria. - Vancouver Art Gallery";Austria;;;

His lifelong involvement in photography incorporates more than fifty years of teaching, professional production for many of Canada’s leading artists and personal art creation incorporating photographic imagery and handwritten narrative text.Born 1946 in Bristol, Connecticut, he grew up in New England, North Carolina and California, where his teen years were spent in the booming post WWII suburbs of San Diego county. In university he studied chemistry at San Diego State College for two years but dropped out and moved in 1966 to the Bay Area, pursuing a life in the arts. He trained as a commercial photographer at Laney College in Oakland, before emigrating to Vancouver in 1970 as a refugee from the violence of America and as the fulfillment of a promise to his grandfather to someday return to the land of his ancestors.His first Canadian job as photo-technician for the Vancouver Public Library Historical Photograph Section, provided an immersion into Vancouver’s visual history and introduced him to the work of photographer Mattie Gunterman. In 1976 he left the world of archives and researched Mattie Gunterman’s life, producing an exhibition of her work that toured 26 venues and led to the 1995 publication of her historical biography, Flapjacks &amp; Photographs.In 1980 he launched a decade-long project The Pancanadienne Gianthropological Survey, crisscrossing Canada in search of monumental human activity and the true meaning of Canada. After producing a series of sixty large scale black and white panoramic photographs he moved to Montreal in 1987 to work on the eastern side of the Survey. On July 14, his second day in Montreal, his panoramas were destroyed in a flood. His lost work was later celebrated in the publication Canada’s Gigantic! Four years in Montreal came to an end with attending the events at Oka, followed by a trip to Japan he’d been putting off since he was 9. The Pancanadienne Gianthropological Survey went largely unfinished after amassing more than 1500 panoramas, but out of it came 500 Fun Years a narrative on Colonialism done for the 1992 500th anniversary of resistance.In 1991 he moved back to Vancouver working for Green Peace photographer Robert Keziere out of Jack Shadbolt’s old studio on Cambie Street providing photographic services and productions for Canada’s leading artists, galleries and publications. He also taught photography at Emily Carr College of Art as a sessional for the next 25 years. For the past thirty years his practice has been in the form of multi panel photographic montages with holographic text. Sometimes this work is an introspective reflection on the ironic tragedy of human existence, as is the case with the two series The Crossroads Of Life and Acts Of God. Other times history and politics provide the narrative as in the millennial snapshot, Four Directions of the Okanagan, and most recently the anecdotal account of 40 years of Vancouver development, Eraser Street.Henri Robideau’s photography has been exhibited and collected both in Canada and internationally.

The dances and plays vary with the seasons of the year:
FOR AUTUMN AND WINTER These are the ""dark"" seasons, when, for the Vancouver Morris Men, the Morris takes on a different, more earthy character - some say degenerate! This is when the Vancouver Morris Men perform WELSH BORDER MORRIS. We wear dark clothes and rags and have our faces ""blacked"" as a form of disguise. The Welsh Border dances are probably the oldest variants of the Morris. Nearly all the dances consist of vigourous stepping and powerful stick clashing accompanied by a loud band comprising melodeon, banjo, fiddle, whistle, drums, triangle, trombone and tuba! See some picutres of us dancing Welsh Border here.
On Plough Sunday (the first Sunday after 12th night), we perform MOLLY DANCING and assoicated rituals from East Anglia. (Traditionally, these dances and rituals were performed on the first Monday after 12th night, but as most of us are at work on that day - unlike olden times! - we've moved the event one day earlier.) For Molly dancing, the men, dressed in old farmers clothes and with blackened faces, typically carry a plough from door-to-door, performing a strange, stamping dance lead by the ""head"" couple - the King and the Molly (a ""man-woman""). The photo to the right was taken in 1992 during our inaugural Molly dance-out, an event which has now become a regular, annual event. The dances, which come from the villages of Girton and Comberton near Cambridge, are based on Feast Dances - communal social dances from the 19th century. Also on Plough Sunday, we perform the ""WOOING"" MUMMERS PLAY from Bassingham. Here are some pictures of the VMM ""in action"" on Plough Sunday, January 2003 and Plough Sunday, January 2005.

They question existing social and cultural systems through the use of humour and irony. Her work often speaks to the ethos and aspirations of those on the periphery of mainstream society, drawing inspiration from counterculture movements that challenge the status quo. Zvonar treats imagery as metaphor, establishing a referential context that calls into question popular conceptions and historical canons to address cultural constructions of power. She often uses a feminist perspective to illustrate how rules of engagement were unbalanced in the past and remain so today. Zvonar has exhibited in solo and group exhibitions throughout Canada and in New York, Australia, Japan and Belgium. In 2008, Zvonar was the inaugural artist at the Malaspina Print Research Residency and was an artist in residence at the Banff Centre for the Arts for the thematic residency Cosmic Ray Research.

However following invitations to create site-specific works in Europe, where bamboo is not a common material, Waqif turned his attention to the solid waste management systems in the cities he visited. This led to the use of more unconventional materials such as discarded wood panels, wiring, metal, steal and plastic waste.

267;Joe;Fafard;https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtistDetail.aspx?FromArtistIndex=False&ArtistId=267;"Nationally and internationally acclaimed artist, Joe Fafard, was born to French-Canadian parents in the small agricultural community of Ste. Marthe, Saskatchewan.  He attended the University of Manitoba (BFA 1966) and Pennsylvania State University (MFA 1968). He was at the University of Saskatchewan, Regina from 1968 – 1974 and visiting lecturer at the University of California at Davis in 1980-1981. Joe Fafard is a distinguished full-time artist and sculptor who currently resides on an acreage near Lumsden, Saskatchewan.    

Mr. Fafard is one of Canada’s leading professional visual artists and has exhibitions of a wide variety of work in galleries and museums across the country and around the world, including the United States, Great Britain, France and Japan.  He is widely recognized as being at the forefront of his art, and his outstanding contributions to the arts have significantly raised the profile of both Saskatchewan and Canada on the national stage. He was named an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1981; awarded the Architectural Institute of Canada Allied Arts Award in 1987; received an honorary Degree from the University of Regina in 1989, and from the University of Manitoba in 2007; received the Saskatchewan Order of Merit in 2002; received the National Prix Montfort in 2003; received the Lieutenant Governor’s Saskatchewan Centennial Medal for the Arts in 2005;  was named CTV Citizen of the Year in 2006; and the Saskatchewan Arts Board Lifetime Achievement Award in 2007.  Joe Fafard will also be receiving his 3rd honorary Doctorat degree from the University of Saskatchewan in June of 2012.  

Perhaps the pinnacle of his career was the touring Retrospective exhibition, hosted by 6 different venues, from September 2007 through September 2009, jointly organized by the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, and the Mackenzie Art Gallery in Regina.  However,  most recently, Joe Fafard was chosen to be honored by Canada Post in their “Art Canada” series of postage stamps, released February 23, 2012.  Three of his artworks are featured on the domestic Canadian stamps, the USA stamps and the International stamps.

In the early 1970’s, much of his sculpture used clay as a medium.  In 1985, he shifted to bronze as his chief sculptural medium, successfully establishing a foundry in Pense.  
His insight and humor characterize his portraits of neighbors, farm animals, wildlife, and famous artists that he came to respect as he learned his craft.  His work in bronze is displayed across Canada and his “cows” have become one of his trademarks.  Some say that Joe Fafard adds a sense of humor to his depiction of the everyday through his artwork; Joe says that he never really took it out...

Quote from Joe: ""I can't put a finger on what compels me to make these things, but I keep doing it anyway.  Well, it is a good way to live and make a living.  I'm quite happy about it!""";Canada;;;http://www.joefafard.com

Politically and socially charged, Yero’s work contends with issues of national identity and plays with the boundaries of kitsch and high art, frequently comprising small-scale ceramic objects that reference pop art and the tourist souvenir.

Most recently he has investigated the effects of light on the eye through his sculptural light installation Passage, which will be presented at Access Gallery as part of the public art project Bright Light, commissioned by the City of Vancouver.
