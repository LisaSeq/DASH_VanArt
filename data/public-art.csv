Born in 1830, ""Gassy"" Jack Deighton was an adventurer who went to sea and was attracted by the gold rush in California and then in New Caledonia (now British Columbia). He didn't strike it rich and instead became a tax man and a steamboat pilot and later ran a saloon which is why he stands on a whiskey barrel. The Globe Saloon which stood on the site was reputedly built in 24 hours by the thirsty workers. (Vancouver Sun, April 7, 2001, H3) The nickname Gassy Jack came from the fact that he talked so much.

110;Gate to the Northwest Passage;"The parameters for the juried competition operated by Parks Canada were to create ""a monument in Vanier Park to commemorate Captain George Vancouver,"" the first European to sail into Burrard Inlet, in 1792. The competition guidelines (1979) specified a sculpture made of permanent materials, ""not wood,"" and that it should not be in the likeness of a man. The form of the work takes off from two 18th century navigational instruments: the plane table and David's quadrant.  Chung Hung said that, ""The objective of the sculpture is to create a symbolic image with definite visual expression, awakening an awareness in Captain George Vancouver's contribution to the world, his remarkable and meticulous surveys which included the north Pacific coast."" The piece frames English Bay from the north view and the Centennial Museum from the south view. The opportunity for a sculpture was offered to the city by Hugh Faulkner, Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs at the time. The project was recommended by the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada.  A five-member jury headed by former parks superintendent Stuart Lefeaux selected Chung Hung's proposal from a local competition and the Parks Board approved the choice.

While I wished to contrast with the building's weight and greyness, and to amplify the theme of living growth represented in the tree plantings in the west half of the lobby, I also wanted the mural to be more than an appropriate decorative design. I wanted some image capable of appealing to the imagination of those who would use the lobby every day so that they would not tire of it and therefore become oblivious to it. What better than a great "" primavera "" for Spring to cheer the spirit? And what more impressive than a large sculptural relief in full colour? And what more poetically exuberant as a permanent symbol than two splendid butterflies breaking from the white cocoon of Spring - the one on the left an abstraction of pieces coming together to form the insect and the one on the right a full-fledged realization? It is hoped that once the mind is focussed in this direction a certain transformational process is suggested and with it certain mythological overtones might unfold.

204;All Our Knowledge has its Origins in Our Perceptions;"A library is an ordered resource for accessing information to further one's knowledge and to enhance one's learning. The route taken to that information can guide the thought process and determine the end conclusions. Leonardo realized this a few centuries ago; Our concept is to challenge users of the facility to rethink their thought processes. 
The most opportune time to accomplish this is before entering the Library - confronting the viewer by having them walk through the piece - and perhaps encouraging them to leave their previous perceptions at the door.
The format in presenting the concept is another Leonardo da Vinci exercise - a geometric discovery of form, mathematics and order. Our interpretation of the exercise challenges the viewer's perceptions: first, by engaging the individual in a visual puzzle that defines the various elements of the geometry in a manner that also juggles their perceptions; and secondly, by making visual references to the cosmos that will take the viewer beyond the physical piece to consider the mysteries of the mind, universe, and of course, the search for truth.

At the top of the pole, a human sits on the head of Eagle-Person, a crest said to have been taken by a family on its ancient migration from Hagwilget country to Kitwancool.  In a lake they saw a large human being with an eaglelike head, wearing a headdress of grizzly bear claws that had water lily leaves around it: all these became crests.

The carving on the pole depicts this supernatural being with an eaglelike  head, human arms holding a frog, wings carved with human  heads, and legs that end in clawed feet.  The outspread wings are an unusual feature for a 'Ksan pole.

Beneath is Grizzly Bear of the Sea; the two dorsal fins signify its marine affiliation.  Variations in Sea Bear crests for this area also have three fins, or one fin with a carved face on it.

The Gitksan have a story similar to the Haida's Nanasimget story, in which Whale abducts a man's wife.

A lone Watchman sits atop four rings, called ""chief's rings"" by the carver.  ""Each ring,"" he said, ""had to be earned by the owner through some special undertaking or major commitment.""  Beneath the rings, Raven appears in his traditional duality - as bird and as human, with the latter crouched between the ears of Bear, who holds Frog before him.  These are two separate crests carved in combination.

Bear's feet rest on the head of the supernatural Mountain Hawk.  ""He's always shown with both a recurved beak and a mouth with many teeth.  It is a crest of my family,"" the carver said.

Also belonging to the Muldoe family is a very old crest known as Halfway Out, seen at the base of the pole.  The origin of this goes back to the war expedition of the warrior Naeqt against the Kitimat people of the coast.  In the early 1920s, his great-grandson gave an account of the gruesome event to Canadian anthropologist Marius Barbeau: ""Naeqt started on the warpath against Kitimat.  On his way down, he came upon a camp, wherein a man sat by himself.  He took his knife and cut the man through the middle almost in two halves, so strong was he.  The wounded man ran into the lake and stood in the water up to his ribs.""  The name and the crest Halfway Out were derived from this incident and brought back by the warrior.";109;;1990;

358;Time Top;"""The inspiration for Time Top came from a comic strip by William Ritt and Clarence Gray called The Time Top that the artist read as a child. In it’s last episode, the Time Top was slowing down over the ocean . . . And the artist has picked up the story line from there and is presenting this sculpture as “a relic of reality, building on the idea of an alternative reality which we each share with a broad diversity. “ A comic book describing the artist’s creative and fabrication processes will be published to coincide with the opening event scheduled for early October 2006.
After being fabricated out of silicon bronze by the Harman Foundry in Sechelt, BC, Time Top was submerged into the ocean water at Gibsons, BC for two years. While submerged, it was connected to an electrical power supply which delivered a low voltage charge to the bronze causing it to attract a deposition of seawater minerals on to it’s surface forming a crust. This process is known as “Electro-deposition of minerals in seawater” or accretion. When the accretion process was complete,
the sculpture was fitted with a polycarbonate dome and now stands 13 feet tall and 10 feet wide. A series of granite cap stones, inscribed with images from the original comic strip, have been installed along the sea wall in front of the sculpture. The sculpture fabrication was completed after the artist’s death in 2003 by a team led by Margaret Pethick, Jerry’s wife, according to his fully documented drawings, specifications and nstructions."" - press release, Maureen Smith, Concord Pacific, August 2006";Sculpture;In place;False Creek foreshore;;Bronze;https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=358;https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/2d285fb7059cf8c9f044de1a4f0a66c8;City of Vancouver;Downtown;North side just west of Cambie Bridge;"{""coordinates"": [-123.115856, 49.2726], ""type"": ""Point""}";Downtown;Time Top is a piece about time travelling.

428;Untitled;"The ambition was to place an autonomous work into the chaos of downtown, with its traffic lights, signage, newspaper boxes, street lamps and traffic, that could sit independently from all of that - an anomalous and allusive object that would create its own context and exist on its own terms amidst the downtown swirl and still belong, while strongly suggesting otherness. In other words to be both part of yet separate from the surrounding architectural reality.

The references are many yet suggest nothing to anchor the sculpture into a specific interpretation. The black and white bands of stone may recall 12th century Italian church architecture. The gold leafed spheres with the projecting necks are suggestive of the retorts of the medieval alchemists whose putative ambition was to transmute lead into gold. The gold forms also suggest the popular symbols of the male and female. In addition the tower or column elevates the gold objects and, by making them inaccessible, enhances their mystery. 

Resting lightly on the column in spite of their considerable mass, the scale and precarious position of the spheres imply the possibility of arrival from some unknown place and time to briefly alight before moving on - a suggestion of a mind or consciousness, of the anthropomorphic? Or the kinetic potential of a bird that briefly alights on a rooftop before flying on.

The placing of real gold - which one usually finds in the sanctity of the church, in museums, or bank vaults - into the public realm is a means of acknowledging that there can be riches for public pleasure, treasure above ground for the eye to see and the spirit to ponder; a recognition that public art is, in every sense, an honouring of and a gifting to the community.";Sculpture;In place;Cielo - Hastings and Bute (1205 W Hastings);1205 West Hastings Street;Marble and gold leafed aluminum;https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=428;https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/a1f0b79f0df38f782190e43984f0698b;Privately owned;Downtown;Northwest corner of Hastings and Bute;;;;221;;2008;
430;Weathervane;"Riding high among the rooftops in Vancouver is an unusual sight that awaits the casual viewer looking upward from street to sky; a 58 inch-high bright copper sculpture of a historical-looking figure riding a lively horse with a ringleted mane, reading a book while sitting backwards. The figure faces the direction of the wind as indicated by the four directionals and the tipped arrow upon which it rests. Closer investigation reveals this to be Rodney Graham’s Weathervane sculpture, which depicts the artist dressed as 16th Century humanist and classical scholar, Erasmus. Absorbed in the solitary activity of reading, the figure is lost in thought and contemplation, not having to worry about where he is going or what lies ahead but, as Rodney Graham puts it, is able to ‘ponder on horseback’  moving forward but also looking backward, to the past.  Rodney Graham based the weathervane on a contemporary anecdote which claimed that Erasmus wrote his most well-known work, The Praise of Folly, on horseback during a journey from Italy to England circa 1510. Graham plays on the absurdism inherent in reading a philosophical treatise on human folly whilst riding on a horse backwards and continues his ongoing philosophical enquiry into cyclical and backward movement; like all his work it contains a complex narrative and is brimful of references: literary, philosophical, self-referential and art historical.  Rodney Graham’s poetic and humourous weathervane, helpfully indicating wind direction and compass points for any serious traveller who looks upward to contemplate the conditions for travel, continues his preoccupation with un-urgent journeying. Erasmus travels from Italy to England leisurely by horseback, the cowboy meanders gently off the beaten track, the buccaneer’s unknown voyage which has thrown him up on a “treasure island”, and the chemically-induced mental journeys that take place in the artist’s head, remind us even if we are not going anywhere in particular that ‘the trip is the thing’.

448;Vancouver Vancouver Vancouver;In the Fall of 2008, the City of Vancouver called for proposals for artist-initiated projects to be created during the 2010 Olympic Games. I ended up pitching this work, a three-part, temporary work called Vancouver Vancouver Vancouver. They liked it. The work is based on the postcard idea from my previous project, Your Private Sky-- postcards that could be used as hand-held frames-- but more specific to the Vancouver vista. The piece consists of 3 custom-made postcards, a roaming kiosk-sculpture that inhabited various sites during the Olympics, and a website where people could post images of the landscapes they had created. Loosely the work invites people to imagine the landscape as their own, as a changing, subjective experience that counteracts the enormity of a mass marketed event like the Olympics. The work was on view at 2 different sites during the Olympic and Paralympic Games in Vancouver.;Socially engaged art;No longer in place;Various;;Kiosk: metal, wood, reflective material;https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=448;https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/1a9dffa7e00557cda6994d1719e144fb;City of Vancouver;;;;;"Vanessa Kwan’s Vancouver Vancouver Vancouver was a mobile sculptural kiosk that could be found at various sites during the 2010 Winter Games. Specially uniformed kiosk attendants distributed what looked like conventional tourist postcards that actually had a die-cut hole in the centre, allowing visitors to frame their vistas in individual ways. The kiosk was both sculptural and practical and acted as a place from which to engage with people and the landscape in an otherwise frenetic environment. Visitors will have a chance to share their custom postcards by posting them to the Flickr group Vancouver Vancouver Vancouver and vancouvervancouvervancouver.com until the end of 2010.
“The postcards are designed as do-it-yourself framing devices, and through them, one might view infinite vistas and recombinant
versions of Vancouver, both here and elsewhere. Viewers can
document their “image within an image” and then post these on the website.” -- Vanessa Kwan";345;Rowan Barrett;2010;

Taking the form of Twitter messages, invited contributors responded to the site’s charged history, the ten-second format and the 140-character limit of tweets. The contributed messages in English were selectively translated into Skwxwú7mesh; Kwak’wala and h?n’q’emin’?m’ and these, along with messages resulting from workshops with urban Aboriginal youth, completed the launch of the project. The billboard itself became an artistic and literary space for exchange between native and non-native communities exploring how language is used in advertising, its tactical role in colonization, and as a complex vehicle of communication. Encouraging dialogue among artists and writers, between First Nations and non-First Nations communities, and between artists, writers and the public, Digital Natives is public art that the public not only ‘receives’, but also produced.

The work is intended as a self-conscious reflection upon the idea of development and demonstrates a simple yet evocative response to the notion of progress and achievement.

501;10 Seconds;"This unique exhibition included work from student, emerging and established artists who delivered a collection of diverse points-of-view that converged in common themes. Artists reclaimed privatized space by interrupting the steady flow of commercial advertising through placement of media art works.  The artists used a wide range of innovative approaches that explored using the video medium in 10 seconds. This included the cinematic, graphic, poetic, animated, performative, dramatic and the mining of archives.  This experimental project claimed and recontextualized privatized space for the creation and presentation of new forms of public art for mass audience consumption. The placement of the works was both subliminal and subversive.  

10 Second launched April 2011 with archival film footage of the first Stanley Park Easter Be-In depicting a hippie chick dancing freely.

Themes included intergenerational and cross-generational arcs in addressing the shared trajectories of family and community histories, and in the process uncovered and preserved history as contemporary media.

A natural geyser is a spectacle that brings attention to what is going on below the surface of things. As a public monument, Geyser for Hillcrest Park replicates this sense of wonder and acts as a spontaneous reminder of underlying forces at work on the site. It is a civic “natural wonder” that makes the green initiatives of the building apparent for all to see. It is not a fountain that operates with a recycling pump. The Geyser acts according to the rhythms and needs of the community, as evidenced by the levels and flow of water through the site. The geyser spray is around 15 feet in height. The duration of the spray is determined by the amount of water needed to fill the tank. The run-off from the Geyser is connected to the grey water cistern in the Hillcrest facility. This cistern is used for all the building’s non-potable water needs, including flushing toilets and irrigation throughout the park grounds. The cistern is fed by collected rainwater from the roof and some grey water from underground sources. However, when the water in the cistern is low, it draws on the city’s drinkable water supply. This is where the Geyser comes in. It is incorporated into this water “loop"" so that clean potable water needed to top up the cistern will first be propelled out through the Geyser and then flow back to the cistern as grey water.";345,411;Blaine Campbell;2012;49.245084, -123.107076

542;Fish Ladder: Salmon in the Capilano;"""When I was first asked to submit a concept for a public art piece to be installed at the Canada Line Station entrance at the intersection of Georgia and Granville Street, I visited the site. Of course I knew beforehand what the function of the entrance was, with its stairs and escalators. But knowing about the function of something versus experiencing it firsthand are different. The first leads to an objective, factual kind of understanding, while the latter leads one to a more poetic understanding in which analogous connections can come to mind. Seeing the toing and froing of commuters going up and down the stairs and escalators brough to my mind remembered experiences of salmon migrating up the Campbell River and its tributaries and the eventual return of new, young salmon downstream to the ocean. Seeing that event left me unexpectedly, strongly affected. I wanted to see if I might be able to bring some aspect of it into my work. So I began making a series of photographs at the Capilano Hatchery in North Vancouver. When the City of Vancouver Public Art Department approached me regarding the creation of a public artwork, I was in the early stages of collecting images of Salmon. But I had not yet reached a decision on how I would eventually employ these images. The Canada Line project brought this into focus for me. 

I wanted whatever image I created for the Canada Line Station entrance to have a strong connection to the function of the site as well as to life on the Coast of British Columbia. I wanted viewers to be able to recognize and appreciate these connections. Further to this, I hoped to trigger people’s thoughts about these wild creatures and how they have exerted such a powerful effect on the rhythm of life along our coast throughout living memory as well as long before that. They have always been central in our cultures and economies. 

I chose to represent the salmon swimming within a structure that recreates the look of a fish ladder rather than attempting to show them swimming in the wild. I believe this allows viewers to connect my image to the structure and function of the Canada Line entrance, hopefully in a whimsical way. However, the image structure is also meant to allude to our processes for studying the life cycle of salmon, controlling and promoting the continued, healthy reproduction of their various wild species, and ensuring continued future harvests.

These fish are full of vitality and a sense of undeterred purpose in the face of all obstacles. They are powerful swimmers that remain wild and mysterious, even when they find themselves channeled through our systems. I have tried to express some of these qualities by catching their images in moments when they are highly animated, swimming through turbulent water filled with swirling bubbles, their bodies dark and unknowable in their watery element."" - Jim Breukelman, 2013";Mural;No longer in place;Canada Line Vancouver City Centre Stn (Downtown);Georgia and Granville (Downtown);"Solid Vinyl sheets - images; Perforated Vinyl - image borders.

(This was a safety requirement). When viewed from station's interior, the borders are clear. Viewed from outside, they are a semi-opaque grey. From the outside, viewers can see some movement of people travelling through the space to the stairs and escalators. Also, the feeling of the mural changes as the light conditions evolve with weather conditions and time of day, which tends to animate the piece, complimenting the captured movement of the fish and water. The mural panels are designed to utilize the structure of the glass panels and their support hardware as integral elements of the overall image structure.

592;Elk for c??sna??m;"When asked to conceive an original work for this downtown site relating to the theme of c̓əsnaʔəm, the city before the city, Dana Claxton considered pre-colonial landscapes and animal nations such as elk, deer, bear, beaver, mink, raccoon, skunk and wolf populations that circulated through these lands by their own natural logic.

Today the local Musqueam people must trade up north and in the interior for elk, as their use remains intrinsic to the society and culture.

With over one thousand crosses on each large panel of glass and approximately two hundred thousand crosses that cover the windows of the CPC, each individual cross becomes the building block or pixels that creates a larger whole. Along with the intuitive arrangements of the crosses, which create a contrast to the rigid grid of the building, these organic swarms of crosses seek to visually erode the architecture making it more porous, almost formless, allowing for a gentler interface with its surroundings.Similar to ambient music, with an emphasis on tone and atmosphere over structure and rhythm, “RGB” seeks to reflect the diversity and inclusiveness of the Central Presbyterian Church and the surrounding West End community.;Site-integrated work;In place;Central Presbyterian Church;1108 Pendrell Street;Glass;https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=618;https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/a5c0a79e6a5d2a7a7d4cdc568087914d;Central Presbyterian Church;West End;The artwork consists of fritted glass that wraps around all four elevations of the building;"{""coordinates"": [-123.130676, 49.281347], ""type"": ""Point""}";West End;Michael Lin uses the glass cladding of the church as a coloured canvas, aligning itself to the history of stained glass windows in places of worship.

649;Sound Waves;Port cities are liminal spaces, where land meets water, ideas mingle, and travelers pause. This space is both literally and figuratively fluid, and it is from this source that our project draws inspiration. This series of posters takes water as its subject matter. These posters are a collaboration between Seattle-based artists Coley Mixan and Krista Schoening, with Schoening’s careful, meditative drawings as a foundation, and Mixan’s expansive digital re-working of those grey-scale drawings into vibrant color as a final step. The result is a composition of wave patterns, hand-drawn, then scanned, digitally collaged, and transformed. Our hope is that the result is peaceful – an ideal state of mind to cultivate at a bus stop – yet dynamic.The energy of the color and the wave pattern is a visual reference to the spirit of the port city, as a cosmopolitan destination for people and ideas. In addition to salt water waves lapping their shores, port cities are often the first places to receive waves of immigrants, new thoughts, and new technologies. The bright, rainbow-inspired palette of our proposed posters, references the welcoming and tolerant spirit of the people of Vancouver.

650;Tidal Pool;In 1971, a health inspector deemed the water in the tidal pool located at New Brighton Park to be unsafe, due to industrial pollution in the Burrard Inlet. A new pool was built the following year and continues to be open to the public from May to September. For the rest of the year, the pool remains filled and waterfowl are allowed to use it, fenced off and protected from human disturbance. As natural processes adapt around sites of conservation as well as industrial sites, each one becomes naturalized in itself, blurring the area between the natural and the artificial. The turning point of anthropogenic influence can be seen as the moment at which an external dependency occurs, and environmental stewardship and conservation efforts to counteract the effects of industry are a prime example of this. New Brighton Park has been an institution of northeast Vancouver for over a century, but the park itself is in a state of change. There has been a recent proposal to reclaim the shore and field next to and including the tennis courts, to transform this area back into a salt marsh. The park’s location creates an ideal vantage point to frame the emblematic and historic aspects of Vancouver in the contemporary moment.

727;Listening. On. Waking Terrain.;Underneath Main and Terminal and extending back towards present-day Clark Drive existed a biologically rich lagoon and marsh area that was used by the Tsleil-Waututh, Skwxwú7mesh (Squamish) and xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam) Nations since time immemorial. The area was covered over to make room for Industry and the CPR railway. The attempted erasure of the space by the colonial forces of the time was thorough and it continues to be built upon today. When looking at some of the public art in Vancouver and other cities we often see a romantic depiction of industrial beginnings and labour. What existed before is often covered and ignored. Knowing that my work will live in this space temporarily I feel it is important to acknowledge its history as well as its present-day. Vancouver is built upon unceded land, sacred sites, complex river and stream systems, hunting and cultivated gathering grounds. It is easy to get lost in the feeling of permanence that urban structures hold. The areas we walk, drive and live upon have place-names and a history of lived experiences.I have lived in Vancouver on and off for around 17 years. Since moving here I have been trying to understand my relationship with this place. I am of mixed Coast Salish ancestry (Klahoose and Sliammon) from my grandmother Agnes Pielle, as well as Wuikinuxv and Kwakwaka'wakw from my grandfather Johnny Hanuse. As a youth I learned that my Grandmother's Nations were historically unified with the Nations here and visually our iconography shares links. The relationship between Nations experienced rupture as a result of colonization. Visually it is important for me to work in continuum with my ancestors. It is also important for me to note that these images do not represent the space they will temporarily live upon, but reflect a relationship and respect for the land and water that my ancestors carried. I strive to continue in this mode of reverence for the spaces we come from and live upon. I also want to recognize my place as an uninvited guest in this space and continue to gain further understanding of it in my time here.An important part of the process in making these pieces has been listening. I have been in conversation with Skwxw’u7mesh artist/knowledge keepers T'uy'tanat (Cease Wyss) and her partner Xuuyaa, as well as other respected community members in the lead up to installing these pieces. I am grateful for their generosity of time and guidance.;Mural;In place;;220 Terminal Avenue;;https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=727;https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/085f18d9733d7dc0c0f3a7d5f778d5a4;City of Vancouver;Downtown;Main and Terminal;"{""coordinates"": [-123.09964, 49.272845], ""type"": ""Point""}";Strathcona;;419;Rachel Topham;2017;49.272845, -123.09964
733;Colour Seekers, The Colour Collector's Way;Groening’s quirky still lifes often include unlikely but not impossible juxtapositions. With colour, comfort, and curiousity leading, objects were chosen for their familiarityor for their particular presence. Each of the thirty-five, 5 x 8- foot glass panels is a composition created in colour stages. The inside viewer (hospital community or patients and staff?) is/are able to examine objects in detail over a 35 foot, colour-changing walkway mural, while the public art viewer sees an expanded version as colour spectrums spanning up five floors.Culled from her collection of jewel-toned glass objects and augmented by flea market finds and borrowed treasures, this giant-sized still life creates a spectrum of colour that is projected into the building in the afternoon and glows at night in a building-sized lightbox. Like large photographic slides, the transparent panels are mounted to a series of glass walkways that make up one wall of the internal atrium. The murals transform the hallways with the changing light, allowing inside viewers to experience a “colour walk” as the sun projects the art into the building and onto the light colored floor.;Mural;In place;Joseph & Rosalie Segal Family Health Centre;803 West 12th Avenue;3M IJ8150 laminated to Clearview;https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=733;https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/ea3d2635feeb8055928b9e990f6611fa;Privately owned;Fairview;The installation is located on the window walkway on the west side of the building;"{""coordinates"": [-123.123566, 49.261523], ""type"": ""Point""}";Fairview;;603;Photo Mike Winteringham, Metropolitan Fine Printers;2018;49.261523, -123.123566
736;All My Favourite People Are Animals;The artwork responds to the architectural and cultural context of the VPLʼs new nəә́ca̓ ʔmat ct Strathcona Branch Library. It aims to highlight a sense of community despite visible economic and cultural diversity of the neighbourhood. The form is inspired by animals from the Strathcona neighbourhood, the historical precedent of narrative bronze doors in relief, and the phenomenon of “Head in the Hole” photo boards. Conceptually, it responds to the colour and texture in the community (particularly the murals), and the desire to identify oneself as part of a community. Bronze doors are heavy and have a ceremonial quality. Often covered in narrative reliefs, they are an early form of storytelling. What is the narrative here at the Library? The name, nəә́ca̓ ʔmat ct, loosely translates as “we are one” in the Musqueam language, and the artwork responds to this sentiment. Introducing animals into the artwork is a way to identify all the library patrons as “one” across a loose geographic area without picking out and representing cultural differences which, while is important to celebrate diversity, becomes tricky when it becomes a symbol of ownership and belonging. We all have an innate desire see ourselves in the world around us and understand that we belong somewhere. Through identifying with a character, a cultural symbol or in the capturing of a moment that contains us (the selfie), we place ourselves within acertain context. The artwork takes the form of ʻHead in holeʼ photo board to create a situation in which people of all ages can simultaneously identify with a character/animal, and see themselves within it. It is a sculptural activation of the imaginative process involved in reading. The holes provide the opportunity to see yourself in the mirror as the animal from a distance, or they invite you to peer inside.;Relief;In place;VPL n???c?a?mat ct Strathcona Branch Library;730 East Hastings Street;Bronze and 1 way mirror;https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=736;https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/534c5d3a02691ac061bd361deee626c0;City of Vancouver;Strathcona;Artwork is located in the front lobby on both sides of the wall area to the left of the front doors.;"{""coordinates"": [-123.088927, 49.281065], ""type"": ""Point""}";Strathcona;All my favorite people are Animals is a sliding door panel made of cast bronze that sits in front of a one‐way mirror.

750;Excavations;Excavations is a composite image made from numerous archival photographs of Vancouver, with the earliest images dating back to the 1880s. Elements from selected photographs were reconfigured to build an impossible architectural structure growing out of a landscape destroyed by logging. Excavations expresses the challenge of piecing together a complete history through the archive and its inherent biases, while also retaining the complexity of Vancouver’s history and ever-changing built environment.After reviewing a large selection of the city’s archival photographs, certain narratives around settlement and industry persisted in the historical documentation. Given Vancouver’s extensive pre-colonial, Indigenous history, questions regarding the under-represented communities and narratives in the archive informed the artist’s approach to producing the image. What history can be understood and given form when the archival material reflects a certain vantage point?Looking at the historical photographs, it is difficult to situate their locations within the city due to the dramatic changes that have occurred in Vancouver’s evolution from a frontier town to a major international hub. With the urban renewal programs of the 1960s, the development of the waterfront for Expo 86, the current housing bubble, amongst many other changes, the city of Vancouver is in constant flux. The majority, if not all, of the buildings used to create this image no longer exist, pointing to the disappearance of countless older properties, creating an historical amnesia. This explicit sense of disorientation and dislocation is represented in the destabilized structure of Excavations.;Mural;No longer in place;CBC Vancouver Broadcast Centre Plaza;700 Hamilton Street;;https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=750;https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/8acf08501748cbe7a8426d185fdff1c7;Vancouver Heritage Foundation;Downtown;On the wall to the right of the main entrance of CBC Vancouver (Hamilton Street plaza);"{""coordinates"": [-123.114234, 49.279663], ""type"": ""Point""}";Downtown;THE WALL is a Vancouver Heritage Foundation public art initiative.

760;Salvage;According to the City of Vancouver’s Zero Waste 2040 statistics, residents, businesses and institutions threw away approximately 351,000 tonnes of garbage in 2015. Most of this “waste” is considered valuable resource material that could have been conserved, reused, recycled or composted instead of sent to the landfill or incinerator.New Delhi-based artist Asim Waqif’s site-specific installation at Offsite combines architecture with a strong contextual reference to contemporary urban design and the politics of urban waste management. Concerns of the environment and social responsibility weave through his work, and for this project Waqif has created an immersive architectural experience built out of materials collected from repurpose stores, the transfer station and landfill in the metro Vancouver area. The structure is assembled using timber, roofing, doors, window frames and sections of walls salvaged from recent demolitions and discarded from local residential and office building.Many of Waqif’s projects respond to an absence of a tactile, experiential aspect in contemporary art by establishing an element of interactivity inside a living, evolving, organic environment. At Offsite he installs mechanical and electronic panels into his maze-like structures to cultivate a multi-sensory experience with sound, light and movement. Visitors are encouraged to move through the installation, allowing them to activate the architecture.

A young Tokyo-based architect—Shigeru Ban—known for his innovative work utilizing paper and cardboard tubing as a building material, was invited to respond to the urgent need for temporary relief shelter. His interest in paper, with its low cost, easy accessibility and simple application, provided him with readymade materials to design and build a sturdy, economical and ecologically sustainable home for thousands who were displaced in the disaster.

780;Building A - Livestock Building;Building A - Livestock Building is an infrared photograph of the 1929 Livestock Building located on the Pacific National Exhibition (PNE) fairgrounds. The image has been captured by a thermal imaging camera, normally used by the construction industry, which has been designed to display differences in temperature by detecting light rays that are invisible to the human eye.Most PNE fairgoers are familiar with the Livestock Building, entering through one of its many barn doors along its south side to cheer on the baby pig races, pet the chickens, llamas and rabbits, and ogle animals large and small. What is not so evident when wandering through this expansive space was its change of use in 1942 when the grounds, then known as Hastings Park, were expropriated by the Department of National Defense.With the declaration of war against Japan, the Government of Canada evoked the War Measures Act and authorized removal of “all persons of Japanese racial origins,” from the west coast “protected area” of British Columbia, even though the majority were Canadian born and Naturalized Canadians. Some 22,000 Japanese Canadians, then labeled “enemy aliens,” were uprooted from their homes and sent to various sites, including internment camps, road construction camps and sugar beet farms in the BC interior, Alberta, Manitoba and Ontario. All personal properties, such as fishing boats, farms, businesses and homes, were confiscated and sold without owners’ consent to cover the costs of their internment.Beginning in March 16, 1942, some 8,000 persons, removed from fishing, lumber and mining villages along the north coast and Vancouver Island, were held at Hastings Park while campsites to which they were eventually transferred were being developed. The stables and cattle stalls of the Livestock Building were converted into a makeshift women and children’s dormitory. Other structures were used as boys and men’s dorms, mess halls, kitchen, hospital and isolation ward. Young men were separated from their families, and sent to work at road camp sites. By September, 1942, there were 3,866 women, men and children living in various buildings on thissite.The archival photograph is from a series that local photographer LeonardFrank was contracted to document for the BC Security Commission, which was created in 1942 to oversee the internment process. This image portrays the interior of the Livestock Building, with bedsheets dividing the living quarters. The thermal photograph suggests a way of seeing what is no longer obvious or visible to us today.;Mural;No longer in place;CBC Vancouver Broadcast Centre Plaza;700 Hamilton Street;Photo on vinyl;https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=780;https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/edbe472e1e030c488b4d7f75a07c3c56;Vancouver Heritage Foundation;Downtown;On the wall to the right of the main entrance of CBC Vancouver (Hamilton Street plaza);"{""coordinates"": [-123.114234, 49.279663], ""type"": ""Point""}";Downtown;THE WALL is a Vancouver Heritage Foundation public art initiative.

786;????? ?????/OCCUPYING CHINATOWN;"&quot;身在唐人街/OCCUPYING CHINATOWN&quot; was Paul Wong&rsquo;s year-long artist residency at the Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Classical Chinese Garden that launched in Spring 2018. As part of the residency Wong created a series of artworks based on 700+ letters in Chinese sent by 90 writers to his mother Suk-Fong Wong, as well as other familial artefacts such as her Chinese medicine collection and photos. The artist also presented a series of programs and workshops with other artists and community members that included a pride event, artist talks, and a series of Chinese herb and medicine workshops.

The letters and artworks were presented as part of his exhibition &quot;淑芳你好嘛 /Suk-Fong Nay Ho Mah / Suk-Fong, How Are You?&quot; at Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Classical Chinese Garden in January 2019, and provided an account of China&rsquo;s shifting cultural and political landscapes told through the personal perspectives of Wong&rsquo;s family, offering a unique understanding of China&rsquo;s transformation in the late-twentieth century. The project was also documented through the website www.occupyingchinatown.com and will include a forthcoming publication.

The resulting gum is a uniquely abstract blend of both fruity and sweet notes, with some sharp and earthy tones. QA CHEW&rsquo;S BUBBLE TROUBLE was distributed in 2018 to trick-or-treaters on Halloween night, and the artists would go on to sell the gum through retailers across Canada.

There has always been a deep appreciation of those who came before me tending to the land in such a way that even now natural beauty is a defining feature in a teeming city. The ancestors and spirit that sits deep in the land are always very apparent to me. I wanted this art then to reflect this and also to be fantastical — to engage both the land and the imagination.I used big colours that match dusk and dawn, I brought in highlights of the old meeting the new (the cherry blossoms versus the cedar), I focused on iconic landscapes within the geography that is Vancouver.

825;Erwin Wurm;"""Inspired by Henry David Thoreau’s essay “Civil Disobedience” (1849), Wurm’s Big Disobedience, (2016) makes reference to an often explored theme: political and social correctness. Related in its use of the human form and apparel, Half Big Suit (2016) stems from an earlier series, Cut, that investigates the fragmented body. Fixed in an awkward position, with one leg extended in the air, the static sculpture conveys a sense of distress experienced while undergoing a durational performance or holding a lengthy pose. In their focus on the body and its motions, these works relateto Wurm’s famous One Minute Sculptures series (XXXX), in which viewers enact simple yet absurd poses for one minute at a time.The relationship between the organic transformation of the body through biological factors and the intentional moulding of objects in Wurm’s work is illustrated in his architectural structure, Flat Iron (2016). Here the artist’s distorted recreation of New York’s iconic Flatiron Building is demonstrated in a melting structure, demonstrating further how the manipulation of volume, scale, form and materiality, can signal transformation in both human and non-human form.Inspired by Wurm’s performative practice, the Gallery invited Mike Bourscheid, an artist who works between Luxembourg and Vancouver, to develop a series of performative interventions at Offsite: Erwin Wurm."" - Vancouver Art Gallery";Sculpture;No longer in place;Shangri-la - Offsite;1128 West Georgia Street;;https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=825;https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/606d7fbce6fee5aacda36d00722505a0;Privately owned;West End;West of Shangri-la Hotel (on W.

847;The Giant Hand And The Birth of Gianthropology;"In the grand scheme of Vancouver’s heritage, the neon period from 1925 to 1960 is perhaps the city’s most heralded example of its transition from gloomy sawmill town to vibrant metropolis. At the peak of this glowing epoch there were thousands of electrified gas filled glass tubes in the Terminal City’s neon jungle. A big hiccup in this brightlights-big-city story came with the blackouts of WWII when civil defence restrictions lead to a new category of no neon outdoor advertising known as “Spectaculars.”When McGavin’s Bakery approached Neon Products for an animated neon of Mother Hubbard’s bread, a “Spectacular” was suggested instead. A hand of enormous proportions was proposed, roughly the same size as the Statue of Liberty’s, but instead of grasping the eternal flame of freedom, Mother Hubbard’s digits would raise on high a leviathan loaf of liberty bread! Genius! McGavin’s, a big supporter of Victory Bonds, approved.Ironically, work on the Giant Hand &amp; Loaf didn’t begin until after blackout restrictions had been lifted at the end of the war. Progress slowed when McGavin’s roof required fortification supporting the added weight. Then the “Spectacular” installers were unavailable, preoccupied by a Log Cabin Cookies billboard featuring a real log cabin with smoking chimney and Mom inside whipping up maple creams. Finally in September 1948, the “Spectacular” crew convened on the roof of McGavin’s and over the next four months assembled the sheet metal loaf and concrete mixed with vermiculite hand, and a cuff hiding the steel bridgework. The finished Giant Hand &amp; Loaf stood atop McGavin’s bakery from 1949 through 1973.When Henri Robideau photographed the Giant Hand &amp; Loaf in February 1973, its cuff had blown away in a wind storm and one of its fingers had rotted off. This image became the first in his life-long photographic study of humanity’s attraction to bigness, a new science he called Gianthropology. He conducted Gianthropological Digs along the Pacific cordillera throughout the 1970’s, culminating in the 1980 exhibition Giant Things, featuring the Giant Hand &amp; Loaf as its signature image. Expanding on that huge success he launched the Pancanadienne Gianthropological Survey, portaging around Canada in the 1980’s, photographing the monumental in the form of panoramic images.";Two-dimensional artwork;No longer in place;CBC Vancouver Broadcast Centre Plaza;700 Hamilton Street;Digital print on vinyl;https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=847;https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/f396dc57ea3b3baf9855a9a67d03008a;Vancouver Heritage Foundation;Downtown;On the wall to the right of the main entrance of CBC Vancouver.;"{""coordinates"": [-123.114234, 49.279663], ""type"": ""Point""}";Downtown;The WALL is a Vancouver Heritage Foundation public art initiative.

863;Gaslight;"Gaslight is a neon sign with the word &ldquo;gaslight&rdquo; written in glowing block letters, circled by the outline of a flickering gas flame. The name is a pun on the nature of neon, as literally light made from gas.

The design of the sign was inspired by the title card for the 1940 film Gaslight. With the film&rsquo;s success, the term &quot;gaslighting&quot; was adopted in psychology to refer to a form of abuse in which the victim is covertly manipulated into doubting their own memory, perception, judgement, and eventually their sanity. More recently this term has been used to describe the manipulation of an entire society through misinformation and destabilizing the concept of truth. 

In the current context fractured by a global public health pandemic, the inequalities of late capitalism, the violence of systemic racism, and a looming catastrophic climate crisis, the term &quot;gaslighting&quot; has re-emerged as a powerful signifier and imminent warning of the gap between perception and reality.";Site-integrated work;In place;Del Mar Inn;555 Hamilton Street;White neon;https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=863;https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/49edd1448ed2431cea8b44149093e8be;Privately owned;Downtown;Northeast roofline of the Del Mar Inn;"{""coordinates"": [-123.112298, 49.281596], ""type"": ""Point""}";Downtown;"A neon artwork mounted on the roofline of the Del Mar Inn.

867;A Constellation of Remediation;"A Constellation of Remediation was a two-year long public art project that exhibited from November 2018 to 2021 that included the planting of Indigenous remediation gardens on vacant and untended lots on the unceded homelands of the xʷmə&theta;kʷəyə̓m (Musqueam), Sḵwxw&uacute;7mesh (Squamish), and səlilwətaɬ (Tsleil-Waututh) nations.

The artists chose the constellation of sites based on the significant decolonization work near these locations through the work of the Native Education College (NEC), Urban Native Youth Association (UNYA), and the Wild Salmon Caravan residency and Working Group on Indigenous Food Sovereignty.

The artists&rsquo; ongoing conversations with developers, City and Parks staff, and the public were an integral part of the project, a process that built connection while also shifting consciousness and awareness about bioremediation, and land-stewardship. 

UNYA Constellation Garden: Southwest corner of Hastings St &amp; Commercial Dr

The artists developed a remediation garden at a former gas station lot and home of an Urban Native Youth Association (UNYA) facility. Indigenous pollinator plants have been planted, creating a field of flowers that will continue to self-pollinate. In partnership with UNYA, the artists also held bioremediation workshops where they invited Indigenous youth to seed the soil and release butterflies on site.

869;Personnages;"Nine mosaic figures inset five columns and span the double-height of the outdoor ground level frontage at the Grosvenor Pacific building. Embedded in black mosaic cladding the nine mosaic figural silhouette drawings will be on both faces of the columns. Some figures will be fully viewed from the outside while others will be more visible from the interior of the building. The mosaic figures will be scaled to the full height of each column face. Central to the proposition of these large-scale outdoor drawings is a concern for what I consider to be drawing&rsquo;s most essential quality; the material presence of line. The rich and long tradition of mosaics is its engagement with and consideration for, process, material and line. A material and process based approach means the drawing must not only be responsive to the architecture, but germane to the community and pertinent to the site. These figural, columnar figures will be captured as modern day caryatides. A considered presence, the figures will be defined and be understood by both the present activities and people that surrounds them today as well as from those the past (history of Leslie House). Solitary and reaching, these gentle and quiet giants will be formidable but not intimidating, abstract yet recognizable, subscribers to no other narrative but the one passersby and visitors choose to impose. Personnages will bear the weight of our unremarkable quotidian and our extraordinary shared existence.

877;Signs in another language (ongoing series);"Signs in another language (ongoing series) presented on twenty digital screens throughout the city from December 6, 2021 - January 16, 2022. 

Drawing from BIPOC poetry, protest, and folklore, this ongoing text-based series examines immigrant narratives of loss, violence, and displacement. Pulling from personal experience moving throughout North America as a first-generation immigrant, the work connects notions of home and heritage to the undocumented labour and disposession experienced by people of color, individuals and families alike. In an era of gatekeeping national borders; rising violence directed towards  immigrants and refugees; and persisting conditions of systemic racial violence, the series juxtaposes national landmarks and marked lands with protest to confront the tenuous conditions of cultural assimilation and belonging, as well as propose measures of resistance and resilience.  

Informed by a lifetime of movement through the United States, Canada, and South Korea, Josephine Lee&rsquo;s interdisciplinary practice is heavily informed by the psychic violence of cultural assimilation and naturalization through migration. Lee&rsquo;s sculptures, installations, and performances, intersect  narratives of dispossession and nationalism, making explicit how ideas of place are entangled within politics of citizenship and national identity. Within this framework, Lee&rsquo;s materials and forms  both signify and complicate overlapping identity formations, and notions of home and belonging. Lee&rsquo;s current research examines how technological transformations connect directly to systems of  political power, environmental degradation, and racial inequality. Further, she explores how these technologies may be configured toward BIPOC futures to enact cultural resilience and propose new orientations within bodies, ecologies, and architectural spaces.";Two-dimensional artwork;No longer in place;;;;https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=877;https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/04491e5268520aba50452511f692b5e7;City of Vancouver;;Twenty (20) digital street sign locations around the city;;;"Platforms: We Are Here, Live is a series of temporary public art projects that presented from November 2021 until the end of October 2022.

881;Spots;"Spots presented on twenty transit-shelter posters throughout the city from April 4 - May 1, 2022.

Lucien Durey and Katie Kozak&rsquo;s collaborations consider lineages of reciprocity that grow from friendship and familiarity.

For Spots, Durey and Kozak walked their neighbourhood searching for and gathering shattered auto glass that they cleaned and sorted. For the artists, this process was reminiscent of picking and cleaning berries, something they both grew up doing. The glass, after being cleaned and sorted, has an alluring appearance. It sparkles in the light, and becomes less recognizable - less easily associated with automobiles - allowing for new connections. These digital studies read at many scales, connecting to imagery of the cosmos, or to views of cellular structures.";Two-dimensional artwork;No longer in place;;;;https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=881;https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/53cbb42e06ec88d1bfa617469f347f74;City of Vancouver;;Twenty (20) transit shelter advertisement locations throughout the city;;;"Platforms: We Are Here, Live is a series of temporary public art projects that presented from November 2021 until the end of October 2022.

Indigenous Matriarchs is a multimedia work that uses poetry and photography to pay tribute to the artist Chrystal Sparrow&rsquo;s Coast Salish and Cree matriarchal lineage.

Sparrow&rsquo;s work was created to respect and honour the powerful women in her family and present Indigenous women as beautiful and moving.

495;Canoe;This two-minute site-specific animation was created by digitally redrawing 1800 frames. Using a series of manipulations and special filters, each frame of the video is hand processed to select and replace the figure in motion with the background of the image, which is water and sky. In the final animated image, the canoeist is barely visible, seamlessly melded to the moving water and sky. The work was created for display on the Georgia Street CBC video situated near the end of False Creek by the Georgia Street Viaduct. Georgia Street was named in 1886 after its namesake, the Georgia Strait. This work marks the entrance to, and historic transportation on, the Salish Sea, via False Creek.

500;River of Crows;"A community-based mural involving numerous experienced mural painters working with the local community, this mural was designed to visually engage pedestrians, cyclists and drivers along the McLean Bike route in and out of the city. For this reason, we collectively decided on a theme of migration, most specifically, the daily migration of crows. The mural suggests the almost mythic presence that crows hold for the population of Vancouver, a bird that has an iconic status in the city. As well, this theme reflects the daily human migration of commuters. 
Artistically, my challenge was to retain a poetic balance between representation and an underlying abstraction, giving the work an overall harmony and animation. In each of my mural projects, a focus is in the integration of the various elements.

In coming up with the motifs, we incorporated about 40 large stencils, generated from small relief prints created in community sessions. This allowed for many individuals to take part, including three mentored youth. Elements are then repeated in differing combinations throughout. Some of the local architecture, including McLean Drive General Store, are referenced, and a large head of a crow in an aboriginal design respects the territory of Native peoples where this wall is located. Artists worked to integrate the upper wall, with the garden area and in particular, with the lower wall, which is made up a series of images from stencils and freehand of insects, plants and seed forms that are indigenous to the area. 
In all, forty-two people took part. The lower area of the mural was particularly well suited to youth participation, with some as young as three years old, and the oldest participant in his eighties. A set of videos were made of the process, as well as an extensive photo-documentation.";Mural;In place;McLean Drive-retaining wall, Britannia High School;Between Williams and Parker Streets on McLean Drive;Acrylic latex on concrete;https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=500;https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/fad1f89a67c56fe0706cc97b941899b7;Vancouver School Board;Grandview-Woodland;West facing retaining wall;;;A two-block long mural on a tiered retaining wall, the final work gives animation and a colourful presence to a previously drab, grey concrete wall.

161;Terry Fox Memorial (1984);"The miracle of Terry Fox was that he was an ordinary young man who turned his response to pain and loss into a triumph of hope and courage. When Terry lost his right leg to cancer in 1977 he decided to raise funds for cancer research. He would run across Canada and ask every Canadian to join the fight against cancer by donating one dollar. He began his Marathon of Hope in Newfoundland on April 12, 1980 heading for the Pacific and home 5,300 miles away. As he ran his daily 26 miles, the lone figure with the distinctive hop-and-skip gait became a symbol that captured the imagination of a nation.  On September 2, Terry was forced to abandon his run when cancer was discovered in his lung. That morning he had written 3,318 miles under the date in his diary. But the Marathon of Hope was not over. Messages of affection and encouragement flooded in and donations to continue the battle against cancer, eventually totaled more than $30 million. In the last year of his brief life Terry received many honours, but Terry Fox will always be remembered most as the young man who demonstrated and took a nation along with him on his Marathon of Hope.

165;Marker of Change;"It took nearly eight years for this monument to come into being. A committee was formed in conjunction with Capilano College and a subsequent national competition drew 98 entries. Toronto artist Beth Alber won with the design incorporating 14 pink granite benches in a circle.  It stands as a reminder of violence against women in society.  The competition policies state that, ""The Women's Monument is conceived as a rational monument to be located in Vancouver, BC, dedicated to all women who have been murdered by men, and naming the 14 women killed in Montreal on Dec 6,1989. It will provide a focus for healing and a tangible symbol of remembrance."" Beth Alber's artist proposal states,  ""The circle, the symbol used by women for centuries to represent a continuum, in a non-hierarchical way, is one of the major elements for this Women's Monument. It is a symbol of women's spirit and is associated with the idea of a protected or consecrated space.""  During the course of the project, considerable controversy was stirred up by the wording of the inscription which is dedicated to ""all women who have been murdered by men"".  Many people felt this inscription was too political. Some were critical about the eventual cost of the monument, approximately $500,000, which they felt could have been put to better purpose.  Many felt that the monument was too specific and was inappropriately sited in a public place, and that public money shouldn't be used to commemorate what was construed to be a private grief.

Set into pavers, they are like markers on a path (of time), an echo.

The project was initiated by artist Alison Diesvelt who, together with the Southlands principal, identified Musqueam artist Debra Sparrow as a partner. Sparrow creates traditional weavings and indicated that she was interested in working on the community art piece. Out of community consultations and workshops, a mural was created with colours and patterns drawn from Musqueam visual traditions.

429;Plot;On August 29th, 2006, I dug a grave by hand from beginning to end at Mountain View Cemetery in Vancouver. This entire process, six hours and fifteen minutes, was captured on HD video in one continuous take. The static shot is composed from the side with the plot at the bottom of the frame. The video ends when I have completely disappeared from the frame and have stopped shoveling. This work was initially exhibited as a scale video projection at the Or Gallery, Vancouver, in February 2007. Along with the video, a scale photograph of the empty gravesite, taken from directly above, was exhibited. The proportions of the excavation (the standard dimensions of a gravesite) happen to be the same as a ‘tombstone’ or artwork label, typically found in gallery or museum exhibitions (one aspect of my job at the Vancouver Art Gallery was to produce such labels). This grave cover thus lists the artist’s name, biographical information, title, media, and date of the work. After its installation at the cemetery, the stone was photographed from the same perspective as the original photograph of the excavation.

441;Monument for East Vancouver;Monument For East Vancouver develops from a graffiti symbol that has circulated for several decades in East Vancouver.  It is a symbol that has circulated in largely provisional terms.  My idea was to formalize the symbol through scale and permanence.  Although its precise origins are not known, the symbol does date back to at least the late 1940s (according to the memory of some senior citizens), which is the beginning of the post 2nd World War period.  Its roots may be linked to the Catholic inscription of East Vancouver culture at that time, home as it was to many Italians, Greeks and Eastern Europeans.  Over the years, the symbol has been adopted as an emblem for East Vancouver as a whole but its appearance has generally been tentative rather than overt.  The lack of overtness is, I feel, symptomatic of the underlying meanings that the symbol expresses.  These meanings have to do with problems of injustice, inequality, subjugation and the trauma of poverty and acculturation, particularly as it relates to immigrant life.  My proposal is for a site that sits on a visually messy and peripheral site in East Vancouver.  The East Vancouver symbol is rendered as a 57 foot sculpture that lights up after dark, the word East and Van encircled by a cross delineation that seems to float all on its own.  The sculpture faces westward towards downtown, towards the centre.  It is an expression of hope and defiance.;Sculpture;In place;;Clark Drive at East 6th Avenue;Concrete, Steel, Aluminum, Impact Modified Acrylic, LED Illumination;https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=441;https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/8f4517d81ac15e21ef22e8ebe9bb1c69;City of Vancouver;Grandview-Woodland;North West Corner of Clark Drive;"{""coordinates"": [-123.077613, 49.265426], ""type"": ""Point""}";Strathcona;Freestanding illuminated sculpture;3;Robert-Keziere;2010;49.265426, -123.077613
445;Aerodynamic Forms in Space;"The work takes its title from a series of photographs I shot in Vancouver in 1977…which documented a series of ‘incorrectly’ assembled toy glider kits…I put the models together not with a view to having them fly correctly, but with an eye to their aesthetic value as purely abstract sculptural forms… Part of the challenge inherent in making these works was the very limited instrumental set from which I had to draw.

When I was asked to create a sculptural proposal for the entrance to Stanley Park, it occurred to me that it might be interesting to return to this work…and try to realize a large-scale version of one of these sculptures: to use the same very limited instrumental set with which anyone who has put together a toy glider would be familiar. The theme of flight seemed appropriate given the location too, for seaplanes are common sights at the entrance to the park.

And the park, of course, is a place where children and adults may very well play with gliders… Plus it would be something that would be interesting when glimpsed only briefly by passengers in vehicles moving at relatively high speed along West Georgia.

A daily Flow concept developed by Fiona Bowie and Sidney Fels, based on using various components, such as time of day and weather, partially influences the behaviour of how images in the work appear. A system custom-designed by Bowie and Sidney Fels with Morgan Hibbert allows figures shot at different times to appear as if they are simultaneously present with a core group of these figures or actors recurring in a manner that implicitly suggests they&#39;re part of a larger narrative. Over the course of the day and night, Flow shifts between live and constructed or theatrical tableaus. During the early morning and after dusk Flow presents as a continuously changing tableau in which hundreds of photographic portraits and landscapes, shot by Fiona Bowie over a number of years, are blended and projected onto a special projection material, switch glass. As viewers come close to the image, the switch glass causes portions of the imagery to disappear as the surface of the glass panels &#39;switch&#39; from translucent to clear.  The scenes in Flow change every two to four minutes. The transitions from one scene to another are so slow that the work has been described as having a dream-like or hallucinatory quality. Because the projection system constantly varies the scale of images (between life size and zoomed in), a particular shot of a particular character may vary from scene to scene, seemingly either fore-grounded or backgrounded. During daylight hours, Flow&#39;s dynamic glass projection surface creates viewing portals, framing details of the activity inside and outside. This provides individuals inside with shifting views and details of the street (these views change according to their proximity to the street) and passersby are able to view activity going on inside the building.

490;Lines in architecture and art;"Lines in architecture and art is a large photomural of a section of coastal landscape, focusing on the frieze of land where forest and water meet, commonly called the high-water mark or high tide line.  This naturally occurring, perfectly level line – made evident by the saltwater rising to the level of the overhanging trees, makes a natural reveal, a feature seen and used in architecture to visually divide the floor from the wall.

En route from the north coast back to Vancouver, I developed the idea to create this large format photographic mural.  A reveal is typically the empty space at the bottom of a wall, where a measured gap is left so the floor and wall do not meet.  In this proposed photomural we will see how the saltwater rises twice a day, cutting an acutely accurate level in the tree boughs as they hang down from the forest landscape.  My interest was first drawn to this subtle occurrence when I realized the visual similarity to the architectural reveal, seen in homes, galleries and museums, a feature that is essential in the contextualizing and display of artwork.

For this mural I decided to repeat the same photo three times in order to draw attention to the architectural references of this work and remove it from the genre of pure photographic documentation.

Situated within the public sphere this proposed photomural presents a very simple meeting of land and water, highlighting how we draw from different ecosystems, the ocean and the forest, to simultaneously sustain our city.  The allusion to the endless rise and fall of the tide will hopefully foster a connection to the changing of time and rethinking of urban space with an environmental sensitivity and an understanding of the shoreline that frames our city.";Mural;No longer in place;Canada Line Granville (Downtown);Granville Street and Georgia Street (Downtown);Adhesive outdoor Non Permanent Vinyl;https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=490;https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/046d04b13aea681c964d411f54b9e3d0;City of Vancouver;Downtown;West wall of transit entrance;;;"The photomural on the west window is a repeated image of a coastal landscape emphasizing the line where the land and water meet at high tide.

573;Giants Among Us;"Giants Among Us is my response to the role of reconciliation between Indigenous Peoples and Settlers to this land. Contained in the entire image are four separate scenes, which reflect narratives about monsters and giants based in oral history from the Central Coast. The themes to be taken away from these scenes are Protection, Escape, Rejection, and Balance.

The image at the top is titled Raven Meets the Cannibal and the theme of this scene is Protection. The Raven in this scene is both human and bird figure. The Raven is known up and down the coast as a trickster, creator and hero or helper of the people. The figure to the right is known as Baxbaxwalanuksiwe or the Cannibal of the North Door. He is known for keeping humans captive and consuming them. This spirit of consumption can affect humans of all backgrounds. In this image the transformer Raven protects himself and returns the cannibalistic energy of greed and consumption back onto its purveyor. 

The second scene down depicts Escape. The captive child spirit has found his way out of the basket of the giantess known as the Atsi. Stories of this giant reach up and down the coast, and she goes by many names. My grandfather, Johnny Hanuse, called her “Skwanee.” She is known to steal unsuspecting children as they wander too far from the village. Often in the stories told about her, it is the most overlooked child who devises the plan to elude her. This piece was made to honour all of the Residential School child escapees. Over the years I have heard heroic stories of successful and attempted escapes from these schools, and many more fled within their imaginations. The children wanted to go home.

The third scene down contains the story of Rejection. P'kvs also known as the Wildman of the Woods is a forest ghost who tries to charm the living into crossing over into the ghost world. He offers gifts, but they are not what they seem. I feel his spirit parallels many figures and entities we deal with in our world today. Many of us choose to cope with reality by accepting illusions, resulting in suffering and living as a ghost. This piece is a reminder to not fall into the false worlds or take in bad medicine.

The final scene at the bottom is the Sisiutl, or double-headed sea serpent also known as Winalagalis. What I learn from this monster is the gift of choice and the need for Balance. The choice to build or destroy, and the choice to love or to hate. This serpent was still feared by many and consumed those who were weak in moral strength, but the greater message of the Sisiutl is that it is a choice to be weak or strong in spirit and mind.

Although I have briefly described the scenes taking place, I also invite the viewer to construct their own narrative. When creating these designs I was conscious that children would be seeing them at bus stops. I wanted to create something that their imaginations could slip into. It is this ability to be free, to wonder, and to dream that was forcibly taken away by the Church and State-run Residential Schools, and it still a battle to hang on to our culture, languages and spiritual practice. I look to our stories for lessons on how to overcome the giants in our path.";Two-dimensional artwork;No longer in place;Transit Shelter Ad Spaces;;;https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=573;https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/21d89d455937e2656c1bd2acdef06fea;City of Vancouver;;;;;"'Giants Amoung Us"" explores monsters and giants from Northwest Coast indigenous oral history and how these stories relate to and parallel reconciliation and dealing with present day challenges.";419;Amanda Strong;2014;

595;Land and Sea;"""Land is usually depicted as steady and stable, Sea as unpredictable, and Sky as free spirited."" ​Our account of Land and Sea is a contemporary tale about our homeland. Legends have been thought about time immemorial and passed on from generation to generation. They are contemporary tales because the story is always changing. An Eagle’s spirit, or the spirit of a bear is not always the same thing. Different characteristics and different places mean different things. Kelly and I have created a contemporary design that demonstrates the way nature flows together. In some cases you will see water flowing down a stream, or the wind blowing through the trees, or the trees themselves and their underground roots. Land is: blades of grass, a deer is prancing through from the forest just for the fun of it. A beaver emerges through the reeds at shore, looking for another tree to chew down; he has found it, but is weary of predators all the time. This time, only small creatures of the forest are hidden. Sea is: the west coast dream. Killer whales are chasing salmon around the Salish Sea. Kelp is flowing in the currents, maybe it is herring spawning season. Flounders down below are oblivious to another world above the surface. Cod are hiding amongst the rocks waiting for an easy meal. Life is transient, hardly still, even though we don't see it, branches are deliberately growing, underwater habitats are being bathed with the tide and water vapors rise into the atmosphere to fall far away. Happenings are all around us, ready to be re-discovered again and again. The broken circle of each design element refers to fragmented spindle whorl artifacts and the separations we see between these elements.

642;RIPPLES;"RIPPLES is a series of three screen-based animations created using a digital moiré technique. This animation technique is central to my practice; it consists in the overlapping of two images generating the illusion of a third image. Each work is produced using this method; two grids of pixels are overlapped and set in motion to generate a digital animated moiré. Alongside the use of digital moiré, the animations from RIPPLES display a common visual treatment: Streaks of hard-edged pixels combined to a minimal color palette. This visual treatment gives each animation unique graphical and kinetic qualities, reminiscent of early computer graphics and endemic to screens and matrix display technologies. The RIPPLES animations are initially shown on computer screens. They are published online as animated GIFs displayed full screen on HTML pages. The animations operate as seamless loops with no beginning or end; their duration online is determined by the viewer’s experience. Meanwhile, each animation encourages a contemplative gaze by combining textural and pixelated elements to a mesmerizing and infinite motion. Specifically, the animations from RIPPLES are informed by memories of rainstorm textures, sand patterns and ocean waves. Each animation attempts to emulate visual and behavioural qualities from these atmospheric elements into digital forms. This process happens slowly through a series of visual experimentations; when a visual experiment feels familiar with the natural references, it is developed to enhance and isolate these specific traits. The resulting works appear like distant recollections of the natural, fluctuating between organic form and digital abstraction. The space of the screen oscillates between depth and flatness, natural and synthetic, merging all into a hybrid form. The flat pixelated graphics flood the monitor, the endless motion does not give rest to the eye. The display becomes a reflecting pool; a space of contemplation on the presence and nature of screen technology.";Media work;No longer in place;Various Downtown Screens;;Digital video file;https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=642;https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/295b6ebd970c423c2bc8390cd298bcac;City of Vancouver;Downtown;Robson & Granville Screen / CBC Plaza / VanCity Theatre / Telus Gardens Screen / Terry Fox Plaza Screen;"{""coordinates"": [-123.1197, 49.281374], ""type"": ""Point""}";Downtown;Nicolas Sassoon has created three digital abstractions using high contrast black and white animation.

647;Untitled, 2016;"My project for Platforms 2015-17: Coastal City further develops two of my areas of interest: the shifting relationship between the digital and the physical, and the material, political, and ecological tension between the natural world and human-centered activities. Situated in a sensitive geographic location, Vancouver maintains environmental responsibilities that have both local and widespread implications. The material traces of these consequences—from remnants of foliage and forests to dried streams of water—are evoked in the work, through both production methods to the imagery and aesthetic. 
The project is an extension of my recent series of unique gelatin silver prints, titled Autograms. The work consists of reproductions of three Autograms resulting in three distinct posters. The project includes images varying in dominant tone (for instance, one that is largely white, one grey, and one black). Creating an overall mood for each poster, this dominant tone can be seen to represent time of day, weather condition, or season. 
These references to time and the natural world are echoed in both the material processes and compositions of the works. The biomorphic abstractions and “textures” are generated by contact printing acrylic paint on translucent plastic film, or utilizing materials that would typically be considered waste (polypropylene drop sheets, shipping packaging, etc.). This uneasy union between synthetic materials produces curiously natural results—the fractal forms are reminiscent of everything from rock formations to cedar bark. In this way, I see the works as a form of temporal excavation, resuscitating the organic ancestries of these petroleum products, even alluding to the networks of transportation and commerce required to procure the materials. These allusions to the distant past, and the pre-historic life forms that died to fuel the future, are complicated by references to more recent imaging technology, such as Photoshopped drop-shadows. 
As these works are made using a contact printing process, the prints are highly detailed and especially compatible with digital enlargement—their magnification revealing fractal forms not visible to the naked eye. Expanded to the size of transit shelter posters, the biomorphic ‘figures’ that populate my works approach human-scale, creating a unique form of engagement and experience. Particularly well suited to viewers in transit, the high contrast figure-ground compositions function as both graphically prominent from a distance, and visually complex on close viewing. This high fidelity fractal detail suggests the imagery of coastal scenery, while the ‘figures’, oscillating between plant-like and humanoid, point to the changing landscape as a consequence of human-centered activities. In this way, the works speak to Vancouver as both a coastal city and an important ecosystem, and allude to our responsibilities as we move within it.";Two-dimensional artwork;No longer in place;Transit shelters around the city;;Inkjet printed backlit film;https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=647;https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/69ffd5ddb6bbe385b9527fca7b5425b1;City of Vancouver;;20 Transit Shelter advertisement locations;;;"Ryan Peter’s images are created through a contact photo-printing process in which he uses acrylic paints, household chemicals, and industrial materials that would be considered waste, registering the traces on translucent plastic film.

Working with traditional silver gelatin printing, the artist explores shifting relationships between physical and digital processes and evokes the tension between the natural world and human-centered activities in the urban environment.

The dolphins swim by, in a pod, weaving as one, the young human hand reaches out, trying to grasp what she is missing or to bond and show affection for something that is so close to us at times and at other times so distant. / Coastal nature’s beauty and wonder.

Taking a form reminiscent of outdated posters, these works isolate elliptical statements on self-improvement and the nature of being in self-referential and critical ways. The Journey references what the artist describes as a ‘West Coast New-Age’ culture, with a specific focus on ideas of travel, movement, and transition. These works play with themes of ‘transit’ and the ‘Coastal City’ in direct response to the situation of the work in the transit shelter ad spaces around Vancouver, through alluding to this regionally specific ‘new-age’ sensibility as well as the commonly used metaphor of ‘the journey’ in self-help literature.The artist would like to thank Nigel Lew and Emiliano Sepulveda for their assistance in making this work.";Two-dimensional artwork;No longer in place;Transit shelters around the city;;Ink on paper;https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=651;https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/3af7cae7a9931b400255608b330f69b2;City of Vancouver;;Twenty transit shelter advertisement locations;;;"Kyla Mallett’s transit shelter posters for the Coastal City project take the form of quasi-inspirational posters created from altered new-age book covers referring to a certain ""West Coast New-Age"" culture.";306;Karen Henry;2016;

664;Peak (Ode to the Lions);"We were thinking about the elegant architecture, the activity of the park, the urbanity of Yaletown - and about the Vancouver&rsquo;s iconic Lions in the distance, just beyond the edge of the city. We were also thinking about the stark, mystical mountain paintings of Lawren Harris, and a Canadian identity tied to a mythical sense of the landscape.

As you walk along the street you see something intriguing that suggests the wild landscape beyond&mdash;the dramatic, faceted form of paired mountains within the upper pool. The forms are identical but &lsquo;mirrored&rsquo; to one another, a play of artifice. Peak (Ode to the Lions) is made of mirror-finish stainless steel&mdash;a refined medium, yet also playful and interactive.

725;The Point;"The Point takes its form from the finger-post sign, used worldwide as a way-finding tool both in a formal civic capacity as well as in informal, ad- hoc situations. Finger-post signs can point to mundane and everyday places (train stations, toilets, bus stops) or at natural wonders, buildings and locations of historical importance and places of deep civic pride. Still other finger post signs point to places left behind or places dreamt about: signs pointing, with distances, to far away cities, inspiring longing for elsewhere or awe at the distances between us. 

This finger-post sign however provides none of these directions; the arrows provide no information and point seemingly randomly in every which way. It is at once both comic and melancholy, referring to possible histories, journeys, and most of all to the constant change and flux of the neighbourhood around it. The sign leaves it up to the viewer to determine the meaning of the arrows, and what they are pointing at. The artwork responds to the neighbourhood&rsquo;s relative newness and lack of specific geographical histories. Ultimately, it invites passers-by to create their own direction and attach the narrative they see fit.";Sculpture;In place;Avenue One;1768 Cook Street;Bronze;https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=725;https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/aec9750155ada48a1dcf9757b199980f;Privately owned - Strata;Mount Pleasant;Located in a plaza on the North-East corner of the property, at the intersection of Columbia Street and 1st Avenue West;"{""coordinates"": [-123.10958, 49.27018], ""type"": ""Point""}";Mount Pleasant;"A 20 foot tall metal post festooned with arrows and implements pointing in many directions.

767;Fitness For All;"""Artist collective Polit-Sheer-Form Office (PSFO) explores the possibilities of shared experience through group activities such travelling, eating, reading and physical exercise. At Offsite, they present Fitness For All, a fivepiece set of exercise equipment evoking campaigns throughout the Peoples Republic of China aimed atmotivating society to pay more attention to health. In the early 2000s the government began to install exercise equipment in public parks throughout the country, and since then the machines have worked their way into the daily regimen of millions of people.While outdoor public exercise equipment is common in China, relocated to Vancouver’s urban core, the work has adopts a new social and cultural context. One that allows the artists to examine whether collectivism is really a social need or just a management tool. In Canada, individualism is a fundamental value yet a newunderstanding of the need for the collective has emerged. Conversely, in China, where collectivism has been a core value throughout most of history, the last decade has indicated an increase in individual pursuits. Through their interactive public performances and happenings, PSFO tests where the desire of collective organizationarises naturally from human nature or is an expression of ideology.Fitness For All encourages audience participation. The work is both purely visual (as contemporary sculpture) as well as purpose built and customized to provide a public service. For PSFO, the fitness equipment is secondary to providing space and opportunity for collective gathering with friends, visitors and passersby, thereby advocating for a model of social organization that benefits the community as a whole."" - Courtesy of the Vancouver Art Gallery";Sculpture;No longer in place;Shangri-la - Offsite;1128 West Georgia Street;;https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=767;https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/2ff9d1f35689d2ea4dcebf6c843a4f2d;Privately owned;West End;West of Shangri-la Hotel (on W.

Many will recognize this particular procedurally-generated animation as the computer program known as Game Of Life, which unfolds frame-by-frame through a simple set of rules that determines whether each pixel lights up, stays lit, turns off, or stays off based on the number of its neighbours which are lit.

Not limited to only Chinese-speaking patrons, CCC is a safe space where those who love Chinese culture can share their interests and where young people or native-born Chinese can explore their roots. It is important to emphasize that Chinatown is not only for Chinese or tourists but a space that welcomes everyone to celebrate the beauty of diversity.When one generation passes their secret recipes or tell their life stories to the next generation, it is like passing down little pieces of cultural heritage.

809;Eight Immortals Crossing the Sea;“Eight Immortals Crossing the Sea” is a familiar story from Chinese folklore about eight immortals crossing the East Sea differently with their special powers. The saying “eight immortals crossing the sea, each with their prowess” has become an allegory to describe how everyone has a unique way to complete the task. The eight immortals, in the context of migration, can be seen as representations and celebrations of diversity in all the individuals that make up the history of Vancouver’s Chinatown: those who have overcome difficulties, and those who have made contributions tothis community, each in their own way.We hope the mural, through its exploration of Chinese mythology in a local context, can act as a catalyst to re-imagine Vancouver’sChinatown, its history, and its people as the work re-interprets a traditional story in celebration of the real stories of the community members who shaped this neighbourhood.

The public artworks at this site continue Falk’s devotion to keen observations of everyday objects, as well as her use of repetition, both of which have been central to her practice for over six decades.For 10 Baseball Caps, the artist produced three different papier mâché caps with slight variations which were then cast in bronze in multiples of three or four and installed in an alternating pattern in primary colours. The caps hang in a group facing downward on the column at the entrance of the building as they might inside the entrance of one’s home, bridging Falk’s explorations of domestic content with the public realm. 10 Baseball Caps bear the traces of human presence while reflecting Falk’s career-long interest in utilizing elements of clothing to explore gender, ritual and status.;Sculpture;In place;35 Park West, Building A;4963 Cambie Street;Bronze;https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=826;https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/c1ff535f19e448f560d03caa89ada330;Privately owned - Strata;Oakridge;;"{""coordinates"": [-123.117951, 49.239464], ""type"": ""Point""}";South Cambie;10 bronze baseball caps, attached to NW face of column.;226;Maureen Smith;2020;49.239464, -123.117951

833;Saltwater City Vancouver/??????;"A neon artwork by Paul Wong honouring the history of Cantonese migrants illuminates 475 Main Street.

The piece is designed to promote discussion around the significance of, and challenges to, Chinese language, culture and preservation of heritage assets in the neighbourhood.

The neon artwork displays the Chinese characters 鹹水埠温哥华, which translates to &ldquo;Saltwater City Vancouver.&rdquo; It commemorates the award-winning Canadian artist and curator&rsquo;s early memories of the neighbourhood.

Speaking about the piece, Paul Wong said &ldquo;I grew up in Chinatown when it was ablaze in bright neon and big colorful signs and at a time when the Chinese community commonly called Vancouver &lsquo;Saltwater City&rsquo;.&rdquo;

The site, between Hastings and Pender, parallel to Main Street on the west side, was chosen by public vote in January 2019. It has particular historical significance as a former location of Vancouver City Hall (1889-1929) where mayors and councillors used the legal power of the City to enact and expand laws that negatively impacted Chinese residents.

&ldquo;Saltwater City Vancouver/鹹水埠温哥华&rdquo; was developed by Wong as part of his year-long residency &ldquo;身在唐人街/Occupying Chinatown&rdquo; at Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Classical Chinese Garden (2018&ndash;2019) commissioned by the City of Vancouver Public Art Program.

&ldquo;Paul&rsquo;s &lsquo;Saltwater City Vancouver&rsquo; neon inspires conversations about the importance of understanding and appreciating both the tangible and intangible heritage assets when we celebrate the significance of Chinatown, its history, people and language in relation to the City,&rdquo; said Vincent Kwan, Executive Director, Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Classical Chinese Garden.

The launch of Wong&rsquo;s residency in April 2018 coincided with the City of Vancouver&rsquo;s formal apology for historical discrimination against Chinese residents in Vancouver. During the residency the artist has translated and examined over 700 letters and artifacts from his late mother Suk-Fong Wong, using them as a source of inspiration to realize workshops, performances, and artworks in photography, video, and sculpture including this neon work. 

The letters and artworks were presented as part of his exhibition &ldquo;淑芳你好嘛 /Suk-Fong Nay Ho Mah / Suk-Fong, How Are You?&rdquo; at Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Classical Chinese Garden in 2019, and provided an account of China&rsquo;s shifting cultural and political landscapes told through the personal perspectives of Wong&rsquo;s family, offering a unique understanding of China&rsquo;s transformation in the late-twentieth century.

841;Koco, Brewers Park, August 11, 2019;The public art Koco, Brewers Park, August 19, 2019 by Peter Gazendam is a single, significant sculpture orientated within the landscape architecture in a central, plaza-like location facing Stainsbury Avenue. The subject of the work is a group of women who practice “square” or “plaza” dancing in the neighbourhood. The tradition has roots in both ancient and modern Chinese history, and is a popular exercise routine performed to music in squares, plazas and parks around the world. These local performances have been a consistent scene in the otherwise rapidly changing community of Cedar Cottage. The sessions occur most mornings in the tennis courts at Brewers Park, at the Cedar Cottage Community House, or other nearby locations. The sculpture depicts one of these dancers, Koco, in six poses, each pose distinct but merging into one another, atop a square base. The sculpture was produced using 3D scanning and printing technology to capture the dancer and her movements before the final bronze form.;Sculpture;In place;;Victoria Drive & Stainsbury Avenue;Silicon Bronze, Stainless Steel;https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=841;https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/abf0b2e0e4817a2876d6782e3f485ae4;Privately owned;Kensington-Cedar Cottage;On private property fronting Stainsbury Ave;"{""coordinates"": [-123.065966, 49.252076], ""type"": ""Point""}";Kensington-Cedar Cottage;Koco, Brewers Park, August 11, 2019, 2020 was commissioned by Strand Development as part of their participation in the City of Vancouver's Public Art Program for Private Development.;580;Rachel Topham;2020;49.252076, -123.065966

853;Narratives from the Emptiest Place;Rina Lyshaug's video Narratives from the Emptiest Place presented on the Vanlive! screen at Robson and Granville (October 5 to November 1, 2020). In this piece, Lyshaug reflects on home as a site for the intervention of the imaginary by presenting an image of a room that challenges the physical boundaries of space.The interjecting video of a quiet home exhibited in an ad-filled environment is a reversal of the usual flow of advertisements, which normally penetrates the domestic site through personal screens. The video simulates time as a projection of sunlight entering the home through a window and moving across an assemblage of walls. The slow pace of the artificial sunlight in the uninhabited space generates a dissonance: a meditative presence embedded within the cacophony of high stimulus messaging emitted by its surrounding advertisements.As a public artwork in Downtown Vancouver, this work takes on a larger cultural significance during the COVID-19 pandemic, when home-confinement is a part of collective experience. The health crisis has relocated shared experiences from crowded bars and sports arenas to isolated homes which are broadcasted as virtual public space through digital communication platforms. This uninhabited room becomes multiple through the eyes of each individual: the act of imaginary projection becomes a form of collective daydreaming.;Media work;No longer in place;Vanlive!

894;Home Edition;"Home Edition shows the living room of artist Jeffery Chong&rsquo;s grandparents, staged as it was on July 2nd, 1964, when Jeffery&rsquo;s grandfather Ging Chong appeared on CBC&rsquo;s newscast, &ldquo;Home Edition&rdquo;. This public art shares the same title. Ging was working at a hotel near Chinatown and had just witnessed a crime. When the news crew arrived to cover the story, Ging was captured on film for several seconds. The family did not watch the news that evening, nor did they know that such footage existed. After the broadcast, the newsreel remained undiscovered in the CBC vault until Jeffery visited its archives decades later.

Jeffery&rsquo;s family research has been a long journey, chasing down documents and photographs to fill gaps not found in archives, and learning stories never shared by a silent generation. Inspired by this newsreel and the setting in which it would have been viewed, Jeffery researched photographs and interviewed family members to piece together how his grandparents&rsquo; living room appeared in 1964, and to learn about Ging, who died before Jeffery was born.

Most of the furniture and household items are original to this room. The reproduction paintings were acquired using coupons from supermarket purchases. On the mantle, containers that once held Chinese vegetables and distilled spirits are displayed as decoration. Tin juice cans, aluminum pie plates, and a fruit crate are reused for houseplants. These items reflect the working class life of Ging, who held many jobs trying to make ends meet.

The living room is of the Mid-Century Builder vernacular, a modern, inexpensive, mass-produced housing option for working class families in the Lower Mainland. The emergence of the style paralleled the rise of television&rsquo;s popularity. The furniture placement is focused on how the family planned time together around the television. The clock, a wedding gift to Jeffery&rsquo;s grandparents, indicates 6:45, the time Ging appeared on television. The television is on but nobody is watching, symbolizing this almost forgotten newsreel, and how the past is fragile if not recorded, or passed down.

Home Edition is the recreation of a time and a place, portraying Jeffery&rsquo;s family history, identity and values, and a reminder of how technology and the built environments of the past brought together families in a way that no longer exists.";Two-dimensional artwork;In place;CBC Vancouver Broadcast Centre Plaza;700 Hamilton Street;Digital print on vinyl;https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=894;https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/b3b2989c143cb74223d0642643050a5a;Vancouver Heritage Foundation;Downtown;On the wall to the right of the main entrance of CBC Vancouver.;"{""coordinates"": [-123.114573, 49.279069], ""type"": ""Point""}";Downtown;The WALL is a Vancouver Heritage Foundation public art initiative.

717;Picture Window;Our homes are repositories for our memories. As our homes are renovated and changed over time, our memories of them are also overwritten. When a home is demolished, those repositories of lived experiences are destroyed. We may have mementos in the form of photographs of the space, maybe a home video, but the physical materials imbued with histories of deep, personal, human interactions disappear. When a physical vessel for memories is demolished, it weakens the memory itself – so how well do our memories survive as we are continually displaced, and our homes are eventually dismantled?In Picture window the artist’s hand is the hand of a labourer. The geometric pattern painted throughout this image is a found pattern from the home’s kitchen, where the stripe was painted on a cinderblock wall. It has been carefully carried throughout the home, touching every room, before going out the bedroom window. This line is transformed into a representation of the gaze of someone living in this house. It is positioned at head height and follows a line of view through the home, pausing where a piece of art once hung, then continuing out the window.At the same time, it is the line of gaze from outside the home into a bedroom. From embodiment to inhabiting, the life of a home is both an extension of the body and a microcosm of society at large. Who lived here in the past? What was their life like? Who will get to live here in the future, in the new home constructed on this site? Who designed and built these homes? Who cleaned and maintained them?

730;Viewpoint;"ARTIST STATEMENT

I consider the space of painting (verb and noun) as a reflective space that engages cultural, material and personal experience. I work with painting as a process of thought. I believe that the physicality of the work and its indexicality of painted marks and gestures (subtle touches, rough scumbles, offhanded smears and studied glazes, etc.) vicariously open this exploratory thinking to an audience.

I am interested in the physiology of perception and how it is personally and culturally codified. My work considers how the world is realized through pictures: that how we picture the world (and how we are taught to picture the world) is how the world becomes. And I consider that if the resolution of a painting-object can be delayed and the process of perception is held open, a maker/viewer may discover agency there. For me the experience of making and looking at the painted object are intimately aligned with the scenes and experiences that I represent. This is a productive alignment. I confuse and equate the space of painting with the space of the world.

ARTWORK STATEMENT

The painted image for this work is a view through trees (on the border of urban and &lsquo;natural&rsquo; spaces) of Burrard Inlet at the start of səli̓ lw̓ ət (Indian Arm). It is seen from an imaginary vantage point: a view that doesn&rsquo;t exist. It is either dusk or dawn and so is unfixed in time as well as place.

This work is intended to provide space for reflection, outside of work and daily tasks: an interstitial moment to get lost in. The painting is dramatically enlarged and backlit. Its installation on the building&rsquo;s soffit is parallel to the ground. The final scale, glow and placement add to a sense of disorientation, offering an hallucinatory respite from the everyday.";Site-integrated work;In place;The Smithe;885 Cambie;An original oil painting digitally reproduced and printed on Barrisol fabric;https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=730;https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/ca69f6bc0e8ef3f07463afb54c0448d6;Privately owned;Downtown;The building soffit canopy area on the sixth level, above the outdoor amenity space, fronting Smithe Street;"{""coordinates"": [-123.116547, 49.277518], ""type"": ""Point""}";Downtown;"Viewpoint is an original oil on canvas painting that was digitally reproduced, fabricated, and installed onto the building&rsquo;s canopy.

734;Charms;I chose charm bracelets as a starting point for this project for their very old history and their ability to integrate universal symbols with deeply personal ones. The first charm bracelets were worn by Assyrians, Babylonians, Persians, and Hittites beginning from 600 BCE. Charm bracelets have seen resurgences over time in various cultures. Now often received as heirlooms, charm bracelets, unlike other forms of property, tend to be passed matrilineally over generations. As they are passed from an older set of hands to a younger one, with it are the rare personal histories embedded in each item. They are tokens of important moments and memories. Whether it is celebration, heartache, or a point of discovery, we carry these histories close on our bodies. Charms, as a proposal, repeats the gesture, holding close to the body of the building.;Sculpture;In place;The Windsor;2395 - 2443 Kingsway;Galvanized Steel, Stainless Steel, Paint;https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=734;https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/b6b3daab38b49d0509e598bc53cadb89;Privately owned;Renfrew-Collingwood;The artwork is a series of 5 leaning posts attached to the buildings fronting Kingsway as well within the pedestrian breezeway between the two buildings.;"{""coordinates"": [-123.05268, 49.24018], ""type"": ""Point""}";Renfrew-Collingwood;"Charms is a series of 5 leaning posts placed throughout the breezeway and the front of The Windsor.

Each piece in this series hints at a narrative, the way that our personal items remind us of our own stories. In a way, they indicate that shared systems such as housing soon become personal spaces, which reflect the lives that inhabit them.

744;Nekú Netsí Kezhi (our home and native land);Nekú netsí kezhi (our home and Native land) is a photomontage of images taken in the City of Vancouver, representing simplified northern First Nations formline design elements and beads. The image is an abstraction with interconnecting forms. The image is symbolic of the complications of reconciliation – the image does not create a complete form. The abstract nature is also meant to represent a celebration. Canada Day has always been a day to celebrate, as my mother was born on the centennial inVancouver. “Nekú netsí kezhi” translates to “our home and native land” in Northern Tutchone language – this is the language of my maternal grandmother.

785;Mother and Child;"My vision for Fraser Commons was a pair of bronze sculptures. Mother and Child focuses on the idea of the family and is sited at the heart of the new development in the public park adjacent to the new daycare centre. This pair of sculptures hopes to foster through its biomorphic shapes, tactile material and series of openings, social and physical activity by encouraging children, teens and adults to interact with the work. The proposed work echoes the Fraser Commons&rsquo; ambition to create a family friendly and calm inviting space from which to escape from the hustle and bustle of the city.

Often regarded as the father of modern British sculpture, Henry Moore and his longtime friend, colleague and fellow sculptor Barbara Hepworth have been, time and again, a source of inspiration for my artistic work. In this instance, Mother and Child draws upon the artists&rsquo; use of abstraction of human and natural forms along with the recurring motif of the family. Like the work of Moore and Hepworth, the sculptures will be situated within the green space of the park and will act as a frame for the landscape.

Mother and Child is equally influenced by the post war &lsquo;play sculptures&rsquo; of British sculptor John Bridgeman (1916 &ndash; 2004) and Danish architect and sculptor Egon M&ouml;ller-Nielsen (1915 &ndash; 1959). Bridgeman and M&ouml;ller-Nielsen&rsquo;s play-sculpture hybrids are models for the work&rsquo;s sense of playfulness and will help to animate the space and humanize the architectural design of the new Fraser Commons.

The choice of traditional cast bronze is a nod to the works of these modernist masters, but is also motivated by my desire to encourage physical interaction, touching and movement through the works on the part of the viewer whose contact contributes to its changing patina. The sculpture&rsquo;s blue finish is informed by my childhood memories of the old Blue Boy Motel Hotel formerly located on the site. The colour provides something of an historical trace of the distinctive &lsquo;Wosk&rsquo; blue tiles which were a part of the Vancouver landscape for so long. The blue colour will also act as a beautiful counterpoint to the copper tones that are seen throughout Fraser Commons.

800;Meristem;The work is a reference to the tissue in most plants containing undifferentiated cells (meristematic cells), found in zones of the plant where growth can take place. Meristematic cells give rise to various organs of a plant and are responsible for growth.The recent transformation of the Cambie corridor from single-family homes to higher density development inspired us to examine the idea of growth. The proximity of Queen Elizabeth Park focused this examination to expression of plant forms.The metaphor of undifferentiated cells allowing complex growth can be exended to the human and social spheres and to the opportunities presented by the dramatic change in the fabric of this neighbourhood.Two sides of the bronze sculpture are smooth planar sections terminating at the top in a point, while the third side is a rough, cast surface designed to retain an ancient-looking patina.

803;Night Prowl;Deanna Bowen’s artistic practice concerns itself with histories of Black experience in Canada and the US. Her focus is the “dark matter” in our midst: people and events that remain just below the threshold of visibility, not because they are impossible to find but because they are difficult for the majority culture to acknowledge due to the systematized racism they expose. Mining overlooked archives, she asks difficult questions about who records history. She reactivates historic documents through a process of extraction, translation and enlargement, and then reinserts this material back into public consciousness in a new form. Over the past two years, Bowen has undertaken exhaustive research in Vancouver to trace a series of intertwined figures who formed an integral part of this city’s Black entertainment community from the 1940s to the end of the 1970s. She mapped a constellation of nightclubs, theatres and hotels where they gathered— many of which have been erased from the city’s physical fabric and its collective memory, but exist as traces in the archives. Her aim is to bring a more complex Black community into visibility, and to posit a powerful counterpoint to common narratives that oversimplify the city’s Black presence by containing it within the spatial, economic and temporal confines of Hogan’s Alley. Night Prowl captures part of a frame of filmed footage accompanying CBC reportage about Vancouver’s ethnically diverse east end nightclubs that aired on October 14, 1959. Racially-motivated anxieties around such nightclubs—and the neighbourhoods in which they were situated—would fuel the calls for urban renewal that would dramatically displace Black communities in the coming decades. The image, which depicts the neon marquee of a now-forgotten dance club after dark, is interrupted by a series of circular voids: visible fragments of batch numbers punched through the cellulose film at its time of manufacture. The holes are a banal artifact found at the end of any film reel. For Bowen, however, the ruptured cellulose reminds us of film’s fragile materiality, compromises its visual seamlessness and undermines our ability to trust photography’s seductive promise of “truth.” Considered this way, even blemished and seemingly insignificant documents can be rich repositories for unintended readings, and for questioning who has been charged with writing our histories, and why.Kimberly Phillips, Curator, Contemporary Gallery;Two-dimensional artwork;No longer in place;CBC Vancouver Broadcast Centre Plaza;700 Hamilton Street;Digital print on vinyl;https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=803;https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/936aa62c8c70968739cf378deb169dd1;Vancouver Heritage Foundation;Downtown;On the wall to the right of the main entrance of CBC Vancouver.;"{""coordinates"": [-123.114234, 49.279663], ""type"": ""Point""}";Downtown;THE WALL is a Vancouver Heritage Foundation public art initiative.

But focusing only on the pain of this tragedy isn’t telling the complete story.

The passion for rebuilding, of bringing back to Vancouver what has been lost, is particularly moving. This tribute explores growth and rebirth - our youth rediscovering their roots and communing with their forebears through whatever means available.

This mural presents an Indigenous story from the cultural knowledge keepers in my extended family along the West Coast. The rope marks where the canoes were pulled up can still be seen on Mount Garibaldi and Mount Baker.This Coast Salish version shows a Thunderbird warning the people that the waters are rising. The Thunderbird resides in the sun. He is the Creator’s messenger. He helps the people on earth by warning them of oncoming events, usually of storms, but now he speaks of climate change. He is telling the people that the waters will keep rising until the people take full stewardship of precious Mother Earth.

865;Weekend Chime;"Weekend Chime is a sound installation that plays notes based on the chorus of Loverboy&rsquo;s iconic song, Working for the Weekend every Friday at 5 p.m., to signal the end of the traditional work week and the beginning of the weekend. More specifically, the chime sounds the two-note melody used by singer Mike Reno while singing the word &ldquo;weekend&rdquo; in the chorus that gives the song its title. The artwork explores themes of class, labour struggles and the versatility of pop music.

Although the lyrics seem to loosely depict a kind of social-recreational interaction, the artist has interpreted the song as an unofficial sing-along anthem for the weekend itself and for working people. The artist Brady Cranfield says &ldquo;I see a parallel between the way everyday people use, reuse, remake and occupy that space and the way that we use, reuse, remake and occupy pop songs. Weekend Chime will hopefully act as a reminder that we&rsquo;re all workers, the true producers of value in the world.&rdquo;

870;Speaker A;"Speaker A is a permanent sound installation that creates impact with the precise manipulation of directional sound as an auditory, &lsquo;sculptural&rsquo; presence. The work includes three distinct audio tracks, installed at specific locations within the plaza. Specialized directional speakers are integrated into the ceiling panels, producing a highly controlled sound &ldquo;column&rdquo; that visitors walk into and out of at will. Customized paving on the ground plane visually identifies the location of the work.

The audio tracks are a series of collaborative texts/stories, gleaned from fourteen writers from around the city that, when taken together, weave narratives that define lives lived in proximity: restlessness and care. Each speaker reveals a randomized program of short narratives that span past, present and future: the work invites listeners to explore the ideas of Restless Futures (Speaker A), Speculative Pasts (Speaker B) and Instructions for Care in the present (Speaker C). Owing to programming by Remy Siu and responsive sound design by Antoine B&eacute;dard, each speaker retains a constantly shifting presence; each listener experiences a unique sequence of narrative and sound.

The narratives are drawn from emerging and established writers, including Lorna Brown, Lili Robinson, Amber Dawn, Aryo Khakpour, James Long, Maiko Yamamoto, Whess Harman, Amiel Gladstone, Jus-tine A. Chambers, Cease Wyss, Vanessa Kwan, Hiromi Goto, Faith Sparrow-Crawford, and Tim Carlson.

The use of sound relates to the artist team&rsquo;s interest in creating experiences in public space that draw attention to ideas, histories and subjectivities that lie beneath the surface of the city: quite literally the things we can&rsquo;t see. Each sound work is part of a greater narrative, each text building on a compo-sition that cannot be encompassed in one person&rsquo;s experience alone. The work is expected to evolve as a presence at the site over time, to stand as both a record of this place, in this moment&mdash;many of the narratives were written in 2020, in the midst of the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and in many ways reflect that unprecedented experience&mdash;while looking forward and back with speculation, anxiety and hope.";Site-integrated work;In place;Second + Main;180 East 2nd Avenue;;https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=870;https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/d51ed6d2e4efc7ffe8ad07127066112f;Privately owned - Strata;Mount Pleasant;Three specific locations in the plaza between the entrance on Main Street and the alley courtyard.

Through this new photographic series of intimate household objects that have been cut up, collaged and reorganized, Svava Tergesen hopes to create an experience where the public can consider how domestic life has changed and shape-shifted throughout this pandemic.

Riffing on these conventions, Tergesen&rsquo;s work displays mutated objects that are no longer whole, but have been transformed into new hybrid creations.

891;The Mirror of Crisis is the Alibi of Production;"The Mirror of Crisis is the Alibi of Production is based on a modified quote from French Sociologist Jen Baudrillard&rsquo;s 1981 book &ldquo;Simulacra and Simulation&rdquo;.

Using the Watergate break-ins as an example, Baudrillard examines how structures of power rely on crises of legitimacy to justify their ongoing existence. In the case of Watergate, the break-in, resulting scandal and resignation all serve to reinforce the realness of the implicated power structures through confrontation with their antithesis.

For this work, the quote is altered to reflect the relation between the ongoing crises of the COVID-19 pandemic and the pre-existing inequities of society. In other words, the crises found within the pandemic are reflections of the broader crises produced by capitalism and other systems that make up the production of society.";Two-dimensional artwork;No longer in place;Billboard at Arbutus Street and West 12th Avenue;;;https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=891;https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/c70f5cd05574bb6050f9cd93b8cd7846;City of Vancouver;Kitsilano;Northeast corner of the intersection, facing east.;"{""coordinates"": [-123.15252, 49.26117], ""type"": ""Point""}";Kitsilano;"Platforms: We Are Here, Live is a series of temporary public art projects that presented from November 2021 until the end of October 2022.

The installation re-stages familiar sights, hazy and half-remembered, from Hong Kong&rsquo;s beloved Kai Tak Airport, which was dismantled a year after the 1997 handover of Hong Kong sovereignty from the United Kingdom to the People&rsquo;s Republic of China. CX 889 evokes the disorienting but warm reactivation of familiar sights, sounds and scents after a trans-Pacific flight&mdash;a state of unwakefulness that may also inform memories of Vancouver in the 1990s, when immigration and urban development changed the city beyond recognition.&quot;

896;The Dusk Meridian;"The Dusk Meridian is a multimedia installation by the Vancouver&ndash; and Kelowna&ndash;based artist Keith Langergraber. Its principal features are scaled-down representations of two fire towers that are physically close but imaginatively separated: the real-life versions sit on either side of the border that divides Canada and the US at the southern boundary of E.C. Manning Provincial Park. The title refers to the moment in time between the setting of the sun and the onset of darkness and to the geographical location of this phenomenon, which endlessly traverses the rotating surface of the planet. It is also a nod to Cormac McCarthy&rsquo;s The Blood Meridian, an apocalyptic neo-biblical novel set in the border between the US and Mexico. These references are reiterated in the phantasmagoric light projected onto the fire towers, the pool of water on which they sit and the wall behind them, evoking a transitional condition somewhere between the setting of the sun and the approach of a catastrophic wildfire. But while the warmth of this light might contrast with the overcast gloom of a Vancouver winter, it offers little in the way of easy comfort.

Langergraber&rsquo;s work serves as an allegory for crossing a point of no return: passing from light into darkness. Here, the devastation wrought by widespread wildfires&mdash;a force of nature unconstrained by abstractions like national borders&mdash;becomes the norm. The fire towers of The Dusk Meridian can be seen as silent witnesses to this transition, much like barometers measuring climactic change that has already arrived.

897;Pedestrian Protest;"&quot;Evann Siebens and Keith Doyle explore how the moving body, whether in solitude or en masse, can become a political act.

Siebens collaborated with nearly 50 local dancers, visual artists and activists to create 24 media performances that reference a historical or recent protest. Each collaborator&rsquo;s singular artistic voice combines with the others in a chorus of protest and gathering that maps our changing city.

1;Captain George Vancouver;"A new city hall and a statue of Captain George Vancouver were commissioned to commemorate Vancouver's Golden Jubilee in 1936. The architect of the new City Hall at Strathcona Park on West 12th Avenue, Fred Townley, proposed the sculpture, commissioned by the Vancouver Canadian Club, be placed on the plaza on the north side of the building. Noted BC sculptor, Charles Marega, was commissioned (for about $5500) to create a life-size sculpture of the man who mapped the harbour in 1792 and after whom the city is named. 
Marega began by setting up 500 pounds of clay on a turntable in his Hornby Street Studio. From the clay model, he made a plaster cast which was then used to cast the finished work in ""Roman bronze"". It was cast at Ornamental Bronze, a foundry in Vancouver. The work was installed on August 20, 1936.The bronze figure standing atop the granite plinth is said to bear little physical resemblance to Captain George. The sculpture was copied from a maquette, which had been fashioned after a painting that was in turn, a copy from an original painting.
An interesting conversation is recorded between Major Matthews, the City Archivist, and Townley.

Townley: ""What do they want to bring that up for? Leave sleeping dogs lie. I've been afraid that matter would come up, but it has not...why bring it up now? It was all in the contract; everything was above board; there's nothing to hide; but if it gets out what it cost, then some fool will start writing to the newspapers, or something, and complain of the waste of money; say it ought to have been given towards the support of some fool scheme of his own, the ""home for incurable dogs"", or some other idiotic thing"".
Matthews: ""Alright; drop it, I don't want to know; the ""Sun"" is publishing a story on the statue, and I suppose they want to put the cost in.""
Townley: ""Well, Charles Marega made it, and baby bonds paid for it...I don't know exactly what it cost; it would be hard to find out; part of it was in the stone work cost. Marega for $5000, and then there was the base; so much per square foot for the base, perhaps $500 for that...""

The sculpture measures about 40 feet by 60 feet and is roughly in the shape of a cross.  Known as ""Phifer's Fountain"", this work was commissioned in 1973 by the CPR and Marathon Realty to address a plaza of which the zoning panel of the day said ""a truly `civic square', as the developers propose, should be more generous and festive in concept."" (Rezoning application, October 1968) This plaza was described in the 1969 development permit application as ""developed with trees, sitting area, fountain, grass mounds, architectural lighting, etc."" Somewhere along the line, the ""fountain"" turned into a 30 foot by 60 foot sculpture.
""The CPR went to Washington State to find someone to design these columns of squared timber to represent, in abstract form, BC forests. The wood used would supply enough timber to build 10 homes."" (A Guide to Sculpture in Vancouver, Peggy Imredy, 1980)
By 2002, some of these columns had deteriorated substantially and Marathon wanted to redevelop the plaza.

65;Untitled (fountain);"The project, for me, was about space for public use where art would help shape, animate and give meaning to that space.

One of the underlying references is the many streams that once flowed into False Creek. The extension of the pavement above the water’s edge is meant to suggest this disappearance underground, to stir memory and history, while at the same time reinforcing the sense of the above ground space as a visually continuous promenade and plaza.

The pond’s dominant feature, a circular granite sculpture sited in the center of the pond, is elevated above the grade of the paving so that a viewer (pedestrian or resident) can fully comprehend its form: a form that might suggest a flower, a wheel, a saw blade....This sculpture also has a spatial function to gather and hold energy as well as operating as a source of water for the pond. The three granite rings embedded in the concrete plaza reiterate the central well of the sculpture from which the water flows and activate the plaza plane. This plane is further activated by the stainless steel rings that echo both the shape of the pond ends as well as the wave movement of the water.

In September of 1968, Douglas Brown, a Vancouver lawyer, talked to sculptor Elek Imredy about his desire to commission a sculpture inspired by the famous Copenhagen mermaid, which could be sited on the great granite boulder just off the northern shore of Stanley Park. Imredy proposed a life-size bronze sculpture of a scuba diver. On Brown&#39;s initiative, the Vancouver Harbour Improvement Society was formed with the intention of financing and facilitating a unique landmark for both Vancouverites and visitors to the city. They raised the money to produce the sculpture privately and Imredy was commissioned to craft the proposed work. The Vancouver Park Board gave permission to the society to place the sculpture on the rock. Because the boulder was often covered at high tide, a precast concrete ring was created and the rock was lifted by a floating crane and set on the ring about 100 feet from its original location. Imredy first took a mold of the top surface of the rock. In his studio, he made a replica of the rock and modeled the figure in clay. Imredy asked his young friend Debra Harrington to model, however the sculpture is not recognizably her image. &quot;When I couldn&#39;t get the model to hold her hand the way I wanted it... I held my left hand in front of a mirror, showing its opposite, and I modeled right one. Of course, I made it a bit nicer, with longer fingers.&quot; A plaster of paris mold was made from the clay figure and the sculpture was cast in fibreglass. This fibreglass figure was flown to Rome where it was cast in bronze at Giovanni and Angelo Nicci&#39;s foundry. On June 9th, 1972, the sculpture was set in place by an electric crane reaching out from shore to the rock 80 feet away and fastened to the stone with stainless steel bolts. The next day the sculpture was ceremoniously unveiled. &quot;Girl in Wetsuit&quot; has become a landmark for visitors to Stanley Park and to boats that enter the harbour.";79;;1972;49.300579, -123.121984

103;David Oppenheimer;"In the fall of 1909 a committee was formed to build a memorial to David Oppenheimer, former Mayor of Vancouver. Oppenheimer was an entrepreneur from Germany and served four 1-year terms as Mayor. He donated land for city parks and for the Rogers sugar refinery. The memorial committee planned to hire Augustus St. Gaudens to build a memorial gate to connect Stanley Park to the City in honour of Oppenheimer but they found out St. Gaudens was dead.  Charles Marega was new to Vancouver and had his first exhibition here with the Studio Club in October of 1909, showing small wax figures. Art critic Felix Penne (Francis Bursill) wrote in Vancouver World, ""These have the right feeling and directness of life and there is every indication the sculptor is capable of broader and more ambitious work - which I shall be glad to see.  Soon Vancouver will not have to propose dead sculptors to design memorials - there are and will be living and capable sculptors nearer home than on the other bank of the Styx.."" The original budget for the project was $50,000, but by the time Marega was commissioned in 1910, the project had become a bust for $4500, of which Marega was paid $3600 and the balance paid for an elaborate unveiling ceremony.

The mosaic theme builds on the community spirit and involvement that created Mosaic Creek Park, located one block off the route at the corner of Charles Street and McLean Drive.

The design of the rocket ship looks like a 1950s Hollywood movie space ship. The design was originally created in 1936 for the Sheet Metal Workers Local 280 float for the Pacific National Exhibition Jubilee Parade on the occasion of the City of Vancouver's 50th birthday. It was designed by Lew Parry and made into a sculpture, built by Neon Products, which was sited at the first Vancouver Air Terminal from 1939 to 1972 when it was scrapped because of rust. In 1985 the Vancouver Transportation Club and the Sheet Metal Workers Union 280 decided to build a replica to celebrate Vancouver's 100th birthday. They located Lew Parry and he still had the original plans. This time the rocketship was built from more durable materials by Terminal Sheet Metal and the Local 280 metal workers. The Rocket was exhibited at Expo 86 and then donated to the city. It was moved by helicopter to it's current site. A Centennial Time Capsule is housed in the base of the rocket, scheduled to be opened 50 years from 1986. It includes items such as an Expo 86 passport with stamps of all the pavilions and recorded messages from local celebrities and many other things.
The City accepted the Centennial Rocket and a site was found for it in the small plaza at the SW end of the Cambie Street bridge.  -information from the website of SMW280";115;Lilli Wong;1986;49.266071, -123.115347

It appears as a game in progress…  Contributing to the idea that there are dramatic consequences to this game, bronze medallions are set into each ball to carry the image of a person in action.  In the form of a portrait,  these human images lend an identity to each ball and also indicate its situation in the game.  Some faces appear triumphant, others suffer the stress of falling or spinning... At the opposite pole each ball carries the image of a star.

Two bronze medallions inset into each ball; one end depicts a star and the other is the face of a person in action. All balls are 60.5&quot; in diameter.

This artwork was officially deaccessioned November 2020. After an extensive redevelopment of the area surrounding Rogers Arena, resituating the artwork became unfeasible within the revised ground plan. As well, the artist had requested that The Game not be re-installed, stating that it was created for a time and place that no longer exist, and that the work is not relevant for other contexts.

The City of Vancouver strives to acquire and commission works of art of the highest quality. Acquisition by the City implies a commitment to the preservation, protection and maintenance of artwork for the public benefit and implies permanency within the collection. As such, deaccessioning is a serious consideration requiring careful planning and adherence to the conditions set out in our Deaccession Policy.

205;Fountain of Time;"""In reference to the library, the theme can be read as fragments which fit together like a jigsaw puzzle to form a larger picture much as one accesses the library in quest of materials to fit in gaps of knowledge or time.
The birth of the mechanical clock circa 1,000 AD was a technological innovation that, as Lewis Mumford pointed out in ""Technics and Civilization"" made possible the mechanical clock as a simile for his paradigm of the workings of nature, a paradigm cited in recent years as contributing to the world's current ecological state: hence the ""ruins"" of a clock face. 
Yet what is watered grows; thus even an ancient ruins can initiate new life, as the unearthing of sculpture from an ancient Greece was seminal in issuing forth that springtime in Italy known as the Renaissance. This is not a fountain of youth but of time, old time reborn in the ever flowing spring of records of human endeavour.
With the advent of the millenium at hand, reflections on the passing of time increase. The numbers observable in Fountain of Time (five, six, seven) reflect a countdown to the millenium: '95, '96 '97. In this context the fountain is a portrait of a certain reality of our time. Yet this particular reality (that of the twentieth century drawing to a close, and what that brings to mind), is only one of many many realities, relevent to those following the Gregorian calendar rather than for example the Islamic, Tibetan or Mayan calendars.

Commissioned by the City of Vancouver Public Art Program. Supported by development funds from the Bentall Corporation and the generous assistance of Mr. Douglas B. Forster.

This work was officially deaccessioned August 2021. After repeated and significant attempts to restore this work over many years, it became clear that no amount of repair work could return functionality and it was detrmined that full removal was the last remaining option available.

The City of Vancouver strives to acquire and commission works of art of the highest quality. Acquisition by the City implies a commitment to the preservation, protection and maintenance of artwork for the public benefit and implies permanency within the collection. As such, deaccessioning is a serious consideration requiring careful planning and adherence to the conditions set out in our Deaccession Policy.

Walter raises questions related to the systems underlying the transactions and power-plays that constitute normal business in the world of real estate development.

Then clusters of stars are created by 160 fibre optic points of light set in granite tiles which in turn are joined by polished brass dashed lines to define familiar constellations. The granite has been designed and laid out in four shapes reflecting four different starlight intensities. Third, alluding to humankind's historical fascination with navigation of the heavens, four large bronze castings of ships, icons familiar to Vancouver's harbours, are set at each port or threshold of entry - a fishing trawler, a gravel barge and tug, and an 18-foot long ferry. Finally, the 40 colour fields of stone aggregate, which overlay and unite all the elements, are abstractions of colour maps made of the Milky Ways' ""cosmic sea.""

The lights, which are at grade level, define constellations in the night sky. The colorful swirls represent other galaxies and deep space objects, and the boats allude both to the actual cargo ships found in Vancouver's harbour and to mankind's use of the stars as navigation tools.     
Kerr's sculpture was commissioned by the developer of the site after a competition sanctioned by the Vancouver Public Art Committee. It has been integrated into the public plaza/walkway that runs diagonally through the site from the corner of Alberni and Broughton to the corner of Jervis and Georgia.
The work addresses pedestrian traffic through the walkway both during the day and as a completely different experience at night. It also allows opportunities for viewing the work from above from suites in the towers and from neighbouring towers.
""Milky Way"" has four elements layered into the work. The first is 39 colorful mosaic spiral galaxies scattered across the site. The brilliantly colorful mosaic tiles stand in marked contrast to the second element, colored stone aggregate which has been laid down in large abstract fiels and which represent the ""cosmic sea"". The third element is 170 fibre optic point lights, in four different intensities, which represent the stars in 36 constellations. These ""stars"" are each set into a black granite star shaped tile and each constellation is further defined by lines of polished brass set into the aggregate. The last element is three large bronze castings of cargo ships, commonly seen in Vancouver's harbour - a fishing trawler, a tug and gravel barge, and a BC ferry - all seen from above.
This work is both public and private, it welcomes both day and night viewing (in some sense providing its own light), and it enhances both public space and the developer's concerns for place making and site harmony.

The objects are things you would normally carry in your pockets: notes, bus tickets, loose change, etc."" Re door and window frames: Our intention is to raise questions around ideas of ownership of and entitlement to the city: whose city?  Do we feel the city belongs to us because it is 'public'?  Or do we think of entitlement in terms of private property: what we own or don't own?"" Regarding the weathervanes: ""The turning of the signs in the wind functions as metaphor for shifting notions of community, place, and a sense of entitlement we feel as citizens.""    ""The title ""Right to the City"" comes from the urban theorist Henri Lefebvre's text by the same name which calls for a different envisioning of the city: for it to be organized for, and belong to, its inhabitants, rather than organized for profit.  The elements in this project explore the contradictions and ambiguities of public and private space.  Although we can identify in general with Vancouver as 'our city', as belonging to the public, space in the city is clearly delineated: either it belong to you or id doesn't.  The space along Nanaimo is technically public space, and unlike the neighbouring yards, anyone can go on this space.  However, in the larger scheme of things, do we feel entitled to it as a space?  We're interested in drawing attention to the public nature of this space and the claims made on the city.  Related to these ideas, this artwork addresses the ephemeral, shifting nature of the site, both in terms of the physical environment and cultural priorities.  This area was once a vacant lot and is now a small park.  We hope the work will open up a space for contemplation and reconsideration on the meaning of these transitions.

414;A Tale of Two Children: A Work for Strathcona;"Excerpted from (RE)VIEWING PRIVATE CHILDHOODS IN PUBLIC PLACES: AN ANALYSIS OF KEN LUM&rsquo;S A TALE OF TWO CHILDREN by Alice Stratford-Kurus.

A Tale of Two Children demonstrates Lum&rsquo;s artistic engagement with social issues of the everyday. Particularly, this work examines the upbringing of a child, not just the child as product of upbringing but, in terms of his or her relationship to others and the moments that influence the child. It is not only the child who is examined but the viewer, too, is drawn into the work and provoked to reflect on their own childhood.

The image that comprises the left half of the installation...undermines the idea that children are insulated or exempt from adult feelings of suffering. The boy is vulnerable, intimidated, and sad [and the] tone is harsh, negative, and angry, obviously detrimental to the boy&rsquo;s self-worth.

The right-hand image text supports the idea that it is a mother who is speaking affectionately to her daughter. At some level, this may translate into pressure that is put on the child to succeed. Issues of race and culture are interwoven with concepts of child-rearing.

Lum&rsquo;s A Tale of Two Children, through the two scenes, illustrates two different points on a large spectrum of parenting. Race, is one factor among many that influences child-rearing. Socio-economic and cultural backgrounds effect the relationship between parent and child as well. Lum conveys the multiplicity of parenting. The work is personal, local, and intimate while at the same time anonymous, global, and public. The complexity of the artwork mirrors the intricate multiplicity of childhood itself.";Two-dimensional artwork;In place;National Works Yard;701 National Avenue;;https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=414;https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/a8a0793448794bbaaea55669bc5a7e58;City of Vancouver;Strathcona;NW corner at Malkin and Thornton Streets;"{""coordinates"": [-123.091885, 49.27515], ""type"": ""Point""}";Strathcona;"Two large aluminum frame panels are printed one side with an image and the other side with a text.

Spanning four stories of the building, Double Blind  translates a Snellen, or eye, chart into Braille by using dome mirrors in order to emulate the raised dots of Braille script.

Dome mirrors are endemic to public spaces and can be found in pedestrian underpasses, hospital corridors, and in commercial retail contexts. They are used for surveillance as well as for the prevention of collisions in pedestrian traffic flow. Public space is often highly contested since it must typically answer to the idealist demands of communal space while also satisfying the concerns for public safety that are frequently associated with control and surveillance. Like many atriums, the new Vancouver Community College’s interior public space has a panoptic tendency: emphasizing ‘insight’ into various interior spaces from specific vantage points. This panoptic tendency is echoed in the domed mirrors, each reflecting a 360° view of the surrounding space.

Double Blind deliberately and emphatically utilizes elements that are commonly found in public space and re-purposes them, thereby highlighting the quality of the space itself, rather than offering a pictorial escape from its reality. Double Blind queries the interlinked ideas of seeing and controlling, acknowledging the importance of the context in which information is acquired and processed, whether that context is a scientific doctrine, social matrix, or language system.

This sculptural work is accompanied by a T-shirt multiple that echoes the installation’s oxymoronic premise: those who can see the work likely don’t read braille, and those who read braille can probably not see the work.

On the back of each T-shirt, an eye chart is rendered in raised letters. Though reproduced in a colour identical to that of the shirt and thereby nearly invisible, the characters are tangible. Conversely, the front of each shirt mirrors the installation’s graphic arrangement in reflective foil, yet these braille dots are entirely two-dimensional, visible, but not available through touch.";317;Photo Technic;2008;49.264344, -123.0808
438;The Drop;"Thrust into the waters of Burrard Inlet, The Drop playfully invites the viewer to reflect on our relationship with this precious commodity of water, and by extension, on the history, complexity, and future of our waterfront.

The Drop pays homage to the element of water and the un-tameable forces of nature which are omnipresent in Vancouver.  The slender, elongated sculpture balances as if a huge raindrop were on the verge of landing on the sea walk.

Although the sculpture takes a natural phenomenon as its starting point, it displays a technical perfection, artificially coloured to correspond to the sky and contrasting with the pale yellow mass of the mountain of sulphur visible on the horizon, waiting to be loaded into cargo ships.

The sculpture’s angle and orientation create a visual dialogue with the architecture of the Convention Centre West, as well as with the bows of the gigantic cruise ships frequently docked nearby.  Like an abstract, radiant-blue ship’s figurehead, it marks the interface between land and water, between nature and technology.";Sculpture;In place;Vancouver Convention Centre;1055 Canada Place (foot of Burrard Street);Polyurethane over EPS;https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=438;https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/45b7fed50c89cf2939bad4d61feab16f;BC Pavco;Downtown;Bon Voyage Plaza;"{""coordinates"": [-123.114089, 49.289384], ""type"": ""Point""}";Downtown;"A large, gentle ""raindrop"" captured in its descent at the moment of contact.";321;City of Vancouver;2009;49.289384, -123.114089
443;A Bright Future;"As part of Instant Coffee's self-proclaimed “Year of Bright Days,” the exhibit, A Bright Future was a four part public commission for ""88 BLOCKS Art on Main"". Instant Coffee has a reclaimed aesthetic and a social intention that played out over the four components: Blanket Bus; Instant Coffee 500; Say Nothing in Bright Colours; and Instant Coffee Light Bar Bus Shelter. All the components functioned as short moments of reprieve as visual fields that are most typically reserved for advertising. Even though Instant Coffee often formally plays with the style of advertising it does so without a clear focused point of sale.

For Blanket Bus, Instant Coffee re-positioned and re-scaled the typical hand crafted afghan blanket, wrapping five sides of an articulated bus with large realistic photo images of the blankets. With its erratic and saturated palette and its repetitive grid line and block form, this vernacular aesthetic of the afghan was synthetically ripe, easily appropriated from its modest domestic crafting place and resituated at a larger scale into a public space, one of advertising. Since the artist collective's inception in 2000, Instant Coffee has used language as part of their practice, designing slogans like ""it doesn't have to be good to be meaningful and ""get social or get lost."" It is through succinct catchphrases, which at times drip with the sincerity of self-help jargon, ring with the urgings of advertising slogans or resound with a dissonant irony, that Instant Coffee applies to Say Nothing in Bright Colours, a series of seven individually hand painted sandwich boards that will be permanently installed in various locations along Main St in Vancouver. 

Instant Coffee often invites other artists to participate in their projects and they continued this tradition for Instant Coffee 500, where they asked 14 artists to design 16 interior car ad cards to be displayed in one bus. Instant Coffee then asked bus patrons to vote on which artist ad card they like best. For two weeks, transit riders voted on their favorite design via text messaging and online.  The winning artist received a $500.00 prize and their design was featured on the outside of another number three Main Street bus for the remainder of the project. For the Light Bar Bus Shelter, Instant Coffee adapted the Main and West 20th bus shelter into a full spectrum light therapy bar. In a place, such as Vancouver, Canada, with much darkness and rain, the negative effects from this lack of sunlight has on individual psyches and the larger social milieu seems at times seems paramount. Instant Coffee offered a moment of solace; only fifteen minutes at the bus shelter was needed for a daily dose of vitamin D and a brighter future.";Site-integrated work;No longer in place;Various locations on Main Street;;;https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=443;https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/a669e9fa1e97f1bac0e914e9e04241ac;City of Vancouver;;;;;"1.

450;THE WORDS DON’T FIT THE PICTURE;"THE WORDS DON&rsquo;T FIT THE PICTURE [was] a text-based work made in response to the context, building and public surrounds of the Vancouver Public Library. The work takes the form of a large freestanding sign that sits in front of the VPL just off the southern entrance of the building in a heavy pedestrian traffic area. The sign takes its cues from an era of signage when signs were once seen as celebratory, grand and iconic &ndash; in effect, as landmarks in their own right as a kind of symbolic architecture (think: Caesars Palace, The Flamingo, The Stardust &ndash; to the landmark of all landmarks, Hollywood). In tracing this lineage, the work also acknowledges a local history when Vancouver was once seen as one of the neon-light capitals of North America. Reminders of this once past persists in signs like BOW-MAC &ldquo;on Broadway&rdquo; (now retro-fitted with the Toys R&rsquo; Us sign) and of course the W atop of what once was the Woodward&rsquo;s building. In adopting the form of a sign, THE WORDS DON&rsquo;T FIT THE PICTURE elides the classifications of traditional sculpture, by evoking a typology that is at once familiar and accessible. Taken within the context of a public library, the work touches upon &ndash; in a very poetic way &ndash; the use of words and language as boundless and imaginative, as a catalyst for a multiplicity of meanings.";Sculpture;Deaccessioned;Originally located at Vancouver Public Library, Main Branch;350 West Georgia Street;Aluminium;https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=450;https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/7df258ff920490e83b88261dfdc12503;City of Vancouver;Downtown;West Plaza;"{""coordinates"": [-123.116458, 49.279552], ""type"": ""Point""}";Downtown;"A large freestanding, three-dimensional sign with soft domed LED light nodes set within Las Vegas style letter boxes spelling the phrase THE WORDS DON&quot;T FIT THE PICTURE. The lights change colour with a computer programmed sequence.

This work was officially deaccessioned June 2020 after careful review of the artwork condition and pending changes to the plaza location. Nearly all of the electrical components had reached the end of their life expectancy. More importantly, restoration and reconfiguring costs were determined to be significantly higher than the original budget when factoring in repositioning expenses that would be required due to upcoming changes to the plaza.

The City of Vancouver strives to acquire and commission works of art of the highest quality. Acquisition by the City implies a commitment to the preservation, protection and maintenance of artwork for the public benefit and implies permanency within the collection. As such, deaccessioning is a serious consideration requiring careful planning and adherence to the conditions set out in our Deaccession Policy.

453;Ice Light;"My pieces are about concerns which play an important role in everyday life as well as in art, in painting, sculpture, architecture: space—movement—time—light. My pieces are not about that what we see, not about that what appears in front of our eyes but about that what is behind them, about that what presupposes seeing. My pieces in the urban environment, in a building or in the outer space do not exist without contact to their surroundings. They exist in a social and local context. This context is defined by the architectural surrounding, the architectural idea and the social situation: the co-operation of different historic, functional, organizational, visual, acoustic, tactile, communicative moments.

The conditions of perception, orientation, movement and communication determine my thoughts about the situation and the development of an idea for the special place. So, my pieces refer to the place and the context, explore existing rooms, architecture, places, situations with different medias and react to the specific parameters of the surroundings:  the place—the situation—the function. On the other hand everyday moments and social connections play a role. I am interested in the specific site that the work exists in. My intention has been to change the nature of the public space. This space altered by my input, becomes the art. 

Light is my most preferred media I deal with because of its special quality. Light is a basic element. Without light there is no life. Besides, light is a very changeable element: Actually light—daylight and artificial light—exists in endlessly different versions. And light is a very ephemeral element; that's why I like it. I am very interested in all these special qualities.";Site-integrated work;In place;City Hall;453 West 12th Avenue;White LED lines, electronic control;https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=453;https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/c781ff12606962120643218f1b5548ad;City of Vancouver;Mount Pleasant;LED lines along the horizontal borders of the building;"{""coordinates"": [-123.113986, 49.260791], ""type"": ""Point""}";Mount Pleasant;At the edges of the buidling white LED light lines are installed.

456;The Birds;"My work for the Olympic Village tries to infuse the ordinary and
commonplace sparrow with a touch of the ridiculous and the sublime. The Birds is a pair of sparrows (male and a female) that, through their large scale– they stand 18 feet tall (5.5 metres) – inverts the normal relationship existing between these typically small birds and the human population.
Locating this artwork in an urban plaza not only highlights what has become the ‘natural’ environment of the sparrow, it also reinforces the ‘small' problem of introducing a foreign species and the subsequent havoc wreaked upon our ecosystems…. The Birds reminds us of our past, but it aspires to challenge the future.

that will lead to a greater sense of shared responsibility and caring.";Sculpture;In place;Milton Wong Plaza at Olympic Village;1 Athletes Way;Stainless steel, hardcoated EPS foam, bronze;https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=456;https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/35fc547295e694b500a7d7b99b2eda0e;City of Vancouver;Mount Pleasant;;"{""coordinates"": [-123.106698, 49.271428], ""type"": ""Point""}";Mount Pleasant;Vancouver artist Myfanwy MacLeod has always been interested in the ability of public art to convey political and historical meaning.

471;Passage;"Passage is one of a series of cultural projects that was on view through the months of February and March along the Carrall Street Greenway in the Downtown Eastside. Yero&rsquo;s project was visible from the street during the day through the window of Access Gallery. Peering through a revealed slot in the otherwise darkened window the viewer will experience intense flashes of light, created by flickering LED lights which momentarily highlight knife blades set against a black backdrop in a completely darkened room. The brief beams of light on the spikes of metal suggest the reflection of light created from a lighthouse beacon, announcing a vast dark sea. Engaging the individual senses, yet disorientating the viewer and evoking the feeling of being alone in the middle of a dark ocean at night, the work offered a sense of solitude within the public space of the street. Its contrasting beauty and brutality also incited inevitable reflections about violence and self-preservation in the marginalized neighbourhood in which the work is situated. As an immigrant to Canada from Cuba, Yero has consistently been concerned with themes that relate to his experience as part of the growing Cuban diaspora. Since living in Canada, Yero still frequently visits his homeland, where many of his family and friends continue to live with limited possibilities to leave. Like the paradoxical freedom and panic that swimming in a wide dark ocean may induce, Cubans are legally bound to their country, which is both home and prison. Many who try to escape across the ocean do not survive, or arrive on the other side only to be returned. The metaphor of death prevails in Yero&rsquo;s practice. The title of the work, Passage, reflects these ideas &ndash; water is evoked as the dual possibility of freedom and death. This work also addresses myriad issues of integration and dislocation facing immigrants to a new country. Exhibited during a global event promoting nationalistic pride through marketing terms such as &ldquo;dream,&rdquo; &ldquo;discover,&rdquo; and &ldquo;celebrate,&rdquo; the installation in turn speaks to the underlying complexities of these utopic ideals.";Media work;No longer in place;Access Gallery;206 Carrall Street;LED lights, knives, enclosed room;https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=471;https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/0049c0f5562814d97639b6d6a7616f01;City of Vancouver;DowntownEastside;Front window of gallery;"{""coordinates"": [-123.103934, 49.282989], ""type"": ""Point""}";Downtown;Sculptural light installation;341;;2010;49.282989, -123.103934

480;We are watching;"We Are Watching, 2010 is a participatory video exhibition that teases ideas focused on public space, surveillance, public art policy and representational power. There are two components: a large-scale projection in public space, and an interior projection within the gallery fed by a live surveillance camera. By using participants’ video clips documenting the Vancouver 2010 Olympic, Paralympic and related events, viewers are asked to consider the ways in which the International Olympic Committee and the City of Vancouver is represented officially, and the alternative views that are largely dismissed, or written over, by the spectacle machine, which serves to homogenize the Canadian subjectivity. Issues explored are surveillance versus sousveillance, the ways in which we watch events, the ways in which we watch each other and the ways in which we are being watched.

Participation consisted simply of video documenting the Olympic, Paralympic and Torch Relay events with cell phones (or any other video capturing device) and the clips were submitted by email and larger files were uploaded to an ftp site. The files were automatically pulled from the inbox and inserted into the video line-up at fifteen minute intervals. These clips were then projected onto the Gallery building, in a gated and locked courtyard, mimicing the inaccessibility of the Olympics. The people could gather on the sidewalk to watch the projection, and that area was monitored by the surveillance camera, which was projected on the wall in the gallery by a live. The gallery audience was essentially watching the audience outside watching the projection of the audience watching the Olympics. 

There is a two-part archival book project that accompanies the work and is available online at www.liddlethought.blogspot.com. The first part includes contextual texts by Kristina Lee Podesva and Danna Vajda  and images of the Torch Relay. The second part of the book will be available in April. It will function as an archive of the event as it unfolds over the time of the Olympic and Paralympic games. This book project will not only document the work, it will also function as a vehicle for the dissemination of the representations collected that provide an alternate view of the “official” versions sanctioned and circulated by VANOC and the City of Vancouver. Multiple subjectivities will add complexity to this overarching image of Vancouver.

486;Girl in the City;"I am interested in how certain human-made structures can function as stand-ins for a city. As icons, they become emblematic of a place. They appear and reappear in personal photographs, are reproduced into small plastic objects sold in tourist gift-shops, and are pictured in mass-produced postcards. These items become souvenirs, tokens of remembrance – in this case of an experience of a place -- that are meant to be severed from the original location and moment of experience, in order to be collected, shared, or circulated.
Girl In The City follows the character Girl as she encounters some noted Vancouver landmarks. In the animations, Girl interacts with these structures, approaches them, then picks them up, revealing them to be toys or miniatures.

493;Adorno and Nose;"""The songs are invitations to play and divertissement, whether private, humming or singing to oneself, or performance, singing out loud to friends or strangers. …People will be surprised, will wonder what they're for. Since the greater part of music in public space is being used to sell things, whether through store ambiance or radio ads, what participation we are allowed is as passive consumers.  As artists, we are interested in the kinds of specific attention that happens when music is lifted out of these economies.
 
The songs are simple melodies in the key of C. The basic musical training required to sight read the songs belongs to anyone who has gone through the high school band program, junior piano classes or been an avid reader of Guitar World magazine. The songs should be accessible to a large, if not very often addressed, audience.

Adorno and Nose, a series of ten songs composed and illustrated by Barry Doupé andJames Douglas Whitman, will be installed from August 15 to October 2, 2011 at 10 locations (listed below) and is one of 13 new public art projects commissioned by the City of Vancouver's Public Art Program for Vancouver 125. 
 
Each poster consists of a song, notated as standard sheet music, the verse, and a drawn graphic. The songs are loosely structured and poetic and meant to engage those waiting for the bus. Complementing this public exhbition will be a performance of the songs on Saturday, September 3, 8pm at the Western Front, 303 East 8th Avenue.

494;Wood Work;Carol Sawyer's video segments collectively titled Wood Work provide a fragmentary glimpse into the history of the logging and lumber industries in BC, employing historic local 16mm film footage shot in the 1930s by Alfred E. Booth. The source footage shows first growth trees being cut down by hand with axes and handsaws, sorted in booming grounds, and sawn into lumber. All of these activities are at the heart of Vancouver's history - a town founded on the site of a sawmill. The artist's careful selection and processing of these source images brings this history back into the present. Inserted into the flow of fast-paced modern advertising on the CoreVision Screens, the images seem grainy and dream-like, as if a memory of the land has returned to haunt the present.;Media work;No longer in place;Robson and Granville Video Screens;Northeast corner of Robson and Granville Streets;digital video;https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=494;https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/be7082fc890c727ef0b748459b018223;City of Vancouver;Downtown;CoreVision Video Screens;;;Wood Work is comprised of seven short video sequences, ranging in duration from 56 seconds to 1:49 seconds.

502;West Pender Place;"This work was commissioned by Reliance Properties. The desire was to have an integrated light art work on the concrete cores of the two towers that would set apart the building and at the same time relate to its surroundings.

The idea for the light installation was inspired by the natural surroundings.The city skyline holds a spectacular backdrop of mountains and water. But the work also responds to the architecture of the building which is constructed of glass all the way around apart from the concrete core. The two towers are connected by a lower section between them. The building is not rectangular but instead protrudes at different angles drawing diagonal lines in the glass facade. These angles can be seen as mountain peaks and they became the starting point for the light design. Led light lines were mounted on the concrete core horizontally. The lines reveal 40 different preset modes which have been uploaded to the rgb modules. One state is a graphic pattern of a single angle that meets up with angle of the building representing the sihouette of a mountain. This image remains the same but the colors change very gradually. The flow of the colors was inspired by the changes of the seasons and the changes of the day. They blend into each other with fades making the transitions look natural as part of the environment. The graphic state is sometimes intercepted by a dynamic state where a motion is simulated of water running down the building. The whole sequence takes more than 8 hours so it is not to be seen as a light show but more as a general presence.";Site-integrated work;In place;West Pender Place;1499 West Pender Street;;https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=502;https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/3d749e3df6dfef9d306ec569c0a8df67;Privately owned;Downtown;;;;;516;;2011;

526;Infinite Tire;"""Southwest and Southeast Marine drive has always loomed in my mind as Vancouver’s spookiest strip. Since childhood, every time I’ve driven down it, I’ve been creeped out by the scary 1930s and 1940s industrial structures to the south — by the endless repetitive loop of fast food and dead underwatered lawns, and by its overabundance of appallingly cheap commercial architecture. In my mind, when children die, their ghosts went to work inside those scary brick buildings. Inside the fast food joints, the fare was probably saltier and greasier than anywhere else, and if you went into one of the businesses or professional buildings, cults would hand you religious pamphlets, and when you left, your clothing would smell like your grandmother’s front hall cupboard and a moldy copy of Life magazine with Pat Nixon on the cover.

I’ve been watching the strip’s ongoing redevelopment over the past decade, and while I’m glad it’s finally changing, I’ve been slightly unsure of what it’s changing into. The stores are now big and clean and shiny and no longer coma inducing — but maybe every time you buy something there, a penguin dies in Antarctica or a tree is chopped down up north, never to be replanted? Well, that’s just me being morbid. It’s now actually much better than it was before — the air of unipolar depression is gone — replaced by the early 21st century’s version of perfected retail, that of inventory-optimized big box shopping. The city has also kept what little good architecture there was and is making a definite attempt to green the place up. So when it came time to think of something for this location, I thought, ‘Why not revel in the consumer fantasia that is the Big Box?’  To do something earnest or minimal in the way that we expect public art to be seemed like a defeatist strategy. Anything sparse or overly cerebral would be optically clubbed to death by a staggering amount of colorful signage, and a chance to say something exciting or uplifting about the place would be lost in a possible miasma of jargon and Corten steel slabs.

Canadian Tire is a store about possibilities; we all know the wonderful sense of creative omnipotence we feel walking down the aisles: Oh, the things I could do with those slats! And why, are those thin-veneer doors useful as tabletops? And look! An eight-can paint-shaker! We know the smell of fertilizer, plywood and galvanized nails. And we most of all know the smell of rubber tires — the smell of long-chain carbon molecules off-gassing in a way that no ventilation system can ever fight. And in Canadian Tire, the rubber you smell is possibly a Motomaster whitewall, and that’s what Infinite Tire is: a Brancusi-esque expression of joy in all things suburban, a wink to the notion of better living through abundance, and a totem of sorts that acknowledges and revels in the choices and creative freedom that can be inherent in industrial sizing systems."" - Douglas Coupland, 2012";Sculpture;In place;Canadian Tire;26 South West Marine Drive;;https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=526;https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/4fa66f210fc77ef34bf5760d07758e8d;Privately owned;Marpole;;;;;391;Emma Peter;2012;

530;Memento (Poodle);Memento is a response to the material culture that contributes so strongly to the character of Main Street. Main Street is more typically characterized by the presence of a multitude of objects that tend to have a personal meaning and relate to everyday life rather than high-end consumption. The poodle was chosen as a motif for the sculpture and other artworks in Memento because it is expressive of the general surroundings of the street. The poodle is not associated with a particular culture, and can therefore be enjoyed by a wide range of people along the street and in the surrounding neighbourhoods. Untitled (Poodle) is intended as a curiosity that will bring attention to the sculpture as a marker or icon of time and place. The sculpture is based on and is a representation not of a living poodle, but rather of a porcelain figurine, the kind of object that might be found in any number of shops along Main Street.;Sculpture;In place;;3333 Main Street;"Sculpture is composed of aluminum; the platform & pole are steel.

550;A Sign for the City;"A Sign for the City is a public art project by Sabine Bitter and Helmut Webber that reassigns the meaning of Vancouver's Nine O'clock Gun. The twelve-pound cannon in Stanley Park is now fired nightly to mark the time. Previously it was fired to signal the close of the fishing day and as a navigational aid. For this project, each daily cannon blast is symbolically dedicated to a cultural, social, or political figure or event in Vancouver or BC's history relevant to that date. The project acoustically memorializes the culture and politics that ground this history, towards imagining Vancouver as a socially and spatially just city. For one year, beginning May 2011, ""A Sign for the City"" circulated the 365 dates through monthly memorial calendars in the form of transit shelter ads, full-page ads in The Georgia Straight, and an edition of calendar notebooks, which could be picked up at the Audain Gallery SFU Woodward's; Or Gallery; READ Books, Chareles H.

557;Radius Mural;"Four paddles of Salish design, represent the four directions, and contain images of Salish serpents, and other glyph forms. The tops of the largest paddle is in flames, alluding to the great fire of Vancouver in 1886, an event that left many from the early city trapped on the shores of the Burrard Inlet.

The three artists worked from different geographic areas, on-reserve and off, in urban and rural contexts, and these differences inform the imagery and speak to the complexity of Aboriginal identities.

591;Substation Pavilion;"Substation Pavilion consists of a small structure constructed of board-formed Ductal concrete, steel and glass, with a door that hints at a possible entrance (although in this case it is merely a
decoy). There are windows on two sides, adding to the illusion of some kind of use value implicit to its presence on the site. The windows are utilitarian, institutional, industrial, with frosted security glass containing wire that obscure a direct line of site into the structure. Within the pavilion is a single, dim light. The pavilion sits immediately to the east of the entrance to the Meccanica development on the corner of First Avenue and Quebec Street in Vancouver, BC. The design borrows from the artdeco influenced electrical substations that are interwoven in Vancouver’s urban fabric. The piece looks as if it has been a long-term tenant of the site, as if it belongs to the area and is a relic of an earlier age. The illusion of its permanence is ruptured by a number of elements that disturb a simple and seamless inclusion in the local vernacular. The pavilion’s design references utility and yet as a consequence of the breaking up of vertical relations within the piece it becomes obvious
something else is going on. What possible use could be made of a structure that seems to have no level floor, let alone barely enough room to turn around in? Why would so much attention be paid to the design of such a small and inconsequential piece of infrastructure?
Substation Pavilion’s design hints at the networks of subterranean connections with the rest of the city and with the past of the site itself. The entire area of False Creek consisted of a marshy wetland prior to its infill. This program of ‘reclaiming’ the tidal areas of Vancouver allowed for the development of the rail yards and industrial infrastructure at the east end of False Creek. This established a horizontal approach to looking at and moving through the growing city, tied as it was to these rail lines. The vertical tendencies of this project aim to introduce the rupturing of the quotidian relationship with the horizontal that dominates movement through the city. The strata formed in the soil of the False Creek area carry the history of the settlement of the area. The networks of the rail yards spread the stories of the people passing through them,
creating layers within the cultural memory of the city. Over the years this cultural detritus molds and rots just as the soil and the structures of the area do. Together they form a humus that
contains the mold that supports life in the city, spreading underneath every structure we build and every story we tell. This is a fertile substrate, not one given to decay and destruction. It supports connections and unexpected developments, much as the rhizomorphic systems of a large fungus will remain hidden, spreading underground and only exhibiting its presence once a
year with its short-lived mushroom heads. It is a constantly shifting and ever-present narrative running just below the surface of the city.

Though their form is sculptural, the lanterns' state of partial collapse evokes an air of incompleteness in deep contrast to their urban environment. They are not resolved in the way architecture requires, but instead hover with a sense of openness. Scaled up and clustered in colourful constellations, their pressence will heighten the dramatic possibilities of the site while making and activating the space below them.

646;Vancouver Coastal: a nomad’s guide to the floating world;"“Vancouver Coastal: a nomad’s guide to the floating world” is the title of a text-and-image based work meant for installation at transit shelters. There is a certain fictional quality to the term “coastal city”, metaphorically on the verge of the imaginary, the otherworldly, the historic and the futuristic. “From a distance, the work mines the history of travel books from the early 19th century Baedekers to more recent and popular guides such as Lonely Planet and Frommers. While these guidebooks are meant as references for the worldly globetrotter, they nonetheless fulfill the desires of armchair vacationers and urban travellers alike. Upon closer inspection, one notes that the poster is a composite of two images. The smaller of the two images is an excerpt from a larger print, an ocean wave pattern from a woodblock print by Japanese ukiyo-e master Toyohara Kunichika (1835-1900) from a series of prints depicting shipwrecks. “Ukiyo” is a Japanese term meaning “the floating world”, a reference to the pleasure-seeking urban lifestyles of Edo-period Japan (1600-1867). The larger image is a photograph of Vancouver’s False Creek shoreline with objects introduced into the image. One might ask: what is an ikat fabric, a piece of imari-inspired china and a silvered cruciform-topped cruet stopper doing on the shoreline? And what could it all mean?
Vancouver Coastal: a nomad’s guide to the floating world” is a work that references contemporary and historic nomadic life. Recent events involving travel, global weather patterns and natural occurrences in the Far East and our own West Coast shores have shown evidence of unexpected material and climactic exchange resulting in an archaeological array of accidental artefacts washing up on all shorelines along the Pacific. After all, cultural exchange is not limited to capitalistic trade. These artefacts are accidental travellers, nomadic ephemera that unwittingly influence our cultural landscape and a testimony to the independent life of objects. As the primordial ocean is the birthplace of life, the coastline is the threshold of humanity, our culture and our civilization. As the knowledge of our culture expands through the exchange of ideas, the history of trade can partly be told through the history of our coastline. From anecdotes predating the Galleon Trade1 to our present-day container cargo ships, our waterways and oceans tell the story of cultural exchange, some through trade while others through natural happenstance. “Vancouver Coastal: a nomad’s guide to the floating world” is both laden with truth and a work of fiction made possible through subjective and speculative storytelling. It epitomises how our coastline embodies our cultural makeup and experiences, and is a catalyst in triggering memories and starting conversations. Regardless of whether these stories are truth, fiction or somewhere in between, they nonetheless allow us to share our experiences without judgement.";Two-dimensional artwork;No longer in place;Transit shelters around the city;;Ink on paper;https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=646;https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/870cb31cd81f4fedbfa55d87d3d76f08;City of Vancouver;;20 Transit Shelter advertisement locations;;;"Vancouver Coastal pretends to be a travel guide book cover and a work of speculative storytelling.

655;Golden Tree;"""I remember growing up and seeing photos of redwood stumps in northern California, photos in which, “Wow! You can drive a car right through it!” I remember always thinking of what an affront to nature it was to use a car as a standard of bigness, but that was the early twentieth century. Later in the century, in 1995, I was in Ireland and phoning home for voicemail messages and had one from my mother that said, “Hi Dear, Constable So-and-so from the Vancouver Police phoned to ask if you’d deliberately left your VW parked inside the Hollow Tree in Stanley Park before you left and, to be honest, with you we never know, so could you give him a ring?” My car had been stolen from an underground parkade and abandoned in the tree by joyriders.
 
    In 2006 Stanley Park’s Hollow Tree, an 800-year-old Western red cedar stump, was damaged in a particularly bad storm, and the City of Vancouver made a stab at removing it. I don’t know what they were thinking. Everyone in the city went crazy. The Hollow Tree is where people had their grad photos taken. It’s where they had their first kiss; it’s where everybody takes their relatives from overseas. In 2009 the Hollow Tree Conservation Society, funded entirely by private donations, stabilized the tree, and in October 2011 it was restored as well as possible, and made open to the public. I was pretty supportive of this project but years later I’m looking at the tree and I can see its days are numbered. It’s a piece of dead wood hundreds of years old. It’s rotting. It’s nature. So I wondered, “Why not transform the tree? Why not put it through a mirror and have it come out the other side as a mythical entity?” This is what I did with the Golden Tree at the corner of SW Marine Drive and Cambie Street. It’s a mirror of something that once was — and will still be for a little while — and it establishes the existence of an evolving city that has an evolving sense of nature and ecosystems. It’s also located at the Canada Line Station, and I realize for many people coming to Vancouver, they’ll see the Golden Tree before they see the Hollow Tree, as if reading the chapters in a book in the wrong order, and isn’t that life?""";Sculpture;In place;;8018 - 8198 Cambie;;https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=655;https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/90975f329f2a9d214762e078a4b12c13;City of Vancouver;Marpole;Corner of SW Marine Drive and Cambie Street;;;;391;photo credit not available;2016;
